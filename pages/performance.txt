====== ComboStrap - Perfomance ======

===== About =====
''performance'' is how fast your page will be perceived by yours user from the moment they click on a link until they see the resulting page.


Google has a more detailed definition of what performance is and gives you a performance score along with performance metrics via the [[https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse|lighthouse product]].

Below is a run of the home page of this website with the [[https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/insights/|lighthouse website version]]

===== Steps =====

==== Stylesheet ====

=== Critical Path ====

All [[styling:stylesheet|published stylesheet (bootstrap and bootswatch)]] are served by defaut from a [[strap:cdn|CDN]]

If you are using only ComboStrap, you can even disable the Dokuwiki Stylesheet for public user with the [[:css#disableDokuwikiStylesheet|disableDokuwikiStylesheet configuration]]

The size of a web page served to the public (user not logged in) can be optimized with the [[:css|CSS optimization module]]

=== Stylesheet Preload ===
We preload stylesheet that are non critical for rendering. For instance, the stylesheet used for [[styling:animation|animation]] are preloaded and added to the page at the end.
==== Javascript ====
All Javascript file are served from a [[strap:cdn|CDN]] and are deferred (loaded at the end) because they are not needed for the first rendering.



==== Sidebar Cache Bursting ====


[[strap:sidebor|Sidebars]] are using heavily the index when they show [[ui:navigation|navigation component]] and have a great impact on the web server rendering time.

With the [[:cache|cache bursting]], the only user impacted is the editor that is recreating the sidebar when he saves the page.


Action: If you have any [[https://www.dokuwiki.org/caching|%%~~NOCACHE~~%%]] instructions in your sidebar, just delete them.
==== Image ====

We follow the [[https://developers.google.com/search/docs/advanced/guidelines/google-images|Google best practices on image]]
=== Lazy load ===

All [[ui:image|images]] are [[lazy|lazy loaded]] by default. It means that they are loaded only when:
  * they are on the screen 
  * they are going to enter in the screen.

=== Automatic Responsive Sizing ===

All raster images (jpg, png, ...) are also automatically loaded with the appropriate sizing. 

If a page contains an big image (say 1200px),  this image will be resized to 300px on a small mobile screen.

Check the [[ui:raster#automatic_responsive_resizing|demonstration]]
