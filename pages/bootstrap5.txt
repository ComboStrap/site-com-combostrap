===== Breaking changes =====

==== Spacing Utility Class ====

The only breaking change is when you use utility class directly from bootstrap with the [[styling:class|class attribute]] (ie without using for instance the [[styling:spacing|spacing utility]] for instance).

They have been [[https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/migration/#utilities-2|renamed]] and we can't do much in this case

The left and right spacing utility have been renamed to support text direction.
  * in place of ''l'' (''left''), you get a ''s'' (''start'') - for classes that set margin-left or padding-left in LTR, margin-right or padding-right in RTL
  * in place of ''r'' (''right''), you get a ''e'' (''end'')- for classes that set margin-right or padding-right in LTR, margin-left or padding-left in RTL

==== Theme ====

The [[styling:stylesheet|Bootswatch stylesheet theme]] are not yet available for version 5.

===== New =====
  * [[https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/getting-started/rfs/|Responsive Font size]] is on by default.
  * [[https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/layout/containers/|The container xxl!]] - You can have a width of 1320 on large screen
  * [[https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/layout/grid/#row-columns|Natural Auto Width for a grid column]] - we support it with the [[ui:grid|row auto type]]
===== Changes preserved  =====

==== Deleted ====
  * [[ui:card_column|Card Columns]] was deleted from Bootstrap 4 but we maintain it as explained in this [[https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/examples/masonry/|example]]
  * [[strap:jquery|Jquery]] is [[https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/getting-started/javascript/#still-want-to-use-jquery-its-possible|no more a dependency for Bootstrap]]. 
  * [[ui:jumbotron|jumbotron]] was [[https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/migration/#jumbotron|deleted]].

==== Modified ====

  * The ''bs'' namespace has been added to all variables:
      * [[https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/customize/css-variables/|color names]]. We maintain the old color scheme without the prefix name by applying the new prefix transparently.
      * [[https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/migration/#javascript-2|data attributes]]
  * ''auto margin'' used in the [[ui:group|Navgroup]] with the ''expand'' attribute has been renamed from [[https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/utilities/flex/#auto-margins|mr-auto]] to [[https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/utilities/flex/#auto-margins|me-auto]].
  * the [[https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/getting-started/accessibility/#visually-hidden-content|assistive technologies class]] given in the [[ui:search|search bar]] has changed from ''sr-only'' to ''visually-hidden''
