====== ComboStrap - About Us ======


<typo lead>
Growing the world GDP of publishers and creators
</typo>
===== About =====
''ComboStrap'' is an organization that is dedicated to grow the world GDP of publishers and creators.

We are an organization localized in the Netherlands that have started in the publishing world 10 years ago.

''ComboStrap'' is the application that powers all the website of our company such as:
  * https://datacadamia.com
  * https://tabulify.com

During the years, we found ourself in a position where we needed to add features to our [[doku>Dokuwiki]] platform and ''ComboStrap'' is the result.

We find it awesome to see that our product is living outside our own world and is helping people all over the world publishing on the internet.

If you need to contact us, you can [[support|email us, create an issue or more]].
