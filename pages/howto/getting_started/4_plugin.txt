====== ComboStrap Getting Started - Third Plugins ======


===== About =====
This page is an optional and informative step that highlights important information that you should now about third party plugins.

[[:combostrap|ComboStrap]] supports [[:support:plugin|third party plugins]] and you can see them all on their  [[:support:plugin|dedicated page]].


You can install any plugin the same way than [[howto:getting_started:2_combo|Combo]] and [[howto:getting_started:3_strap|Strap]] with the [[doku>plugin:extension|extension manager]].




===== Move =====

We support the [[docs:page:move|move plugin]]

You can quickly move a page with the ''rename'' action in the [[docs:layout:page:railbar|railbar]].

<note warning>
If you move page on the server via the file system (for instance in case of a new installation), you should update your index with the [[support:plugin#search index manager|Search Index Manager]] otherwise the rewrite of the link will not succeed with the move plugin and you will get [[docs:quality:broken_link|broken links]].
