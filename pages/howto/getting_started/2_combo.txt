====== ComboStrap Getting Started - Combo Installation ======

===== About =====
''combo'' contains all components:
  * The [[docs:theme|theme]]
  * The [[docs:component|collection of UI component]]
  * The [[docs:router:router|router]]
  * The [[docs:metadata:metadata|Page Metadata]]
  * The [[docs:seo:seo|SEO module]]
  * and many more.


===== Steps =====

==== DokuWiki Pre-requisites ====
In case, you have not followed the [[howto:getting_started:1_dokuwiki|dokuwiki step]], you should install ''ComboStrap'' on the last dokuwiki version.

If you don't know the version of your installation, the [[1_dokuwiki#dokuwiki_version_check|dokuwiki version check]] will help you.
==== Go to the Extension Manager ====

To install the ''Combo'' plugin:
  * Click on the ''Admin'' link to go to the [[doku>admin_window|Admin Window]]. ie ''https://yourdomain.com/?do=admin''

{{::dokuwiki_admin_window_default_template.png|}}

  * Click on the ''Extension Manager'' link to go to the [[doku>plugin:extension|Extension Manager plugin]].
  * Click on the ''Search and Install'' link to go to the ''Search tab''

==== Install the SQLite extension ====

''combo'' is saving its data in a sqlite database and therefore uses this extension.

  * Search for the term ''sqlite''
  * Click on the ''install'' button.

==== Do you have any other plugins ? ====

''ComboStrap'' is tested against [[howto:getting_started:4_plugin|third party plugins]] but we can't test them all.

This application has a large code base going from [[:docs:cache:cache|cache]] to [[docs:router:router|routing]] and [[docs:component|user interface]] management.

Plugins that are too old or does not respect the DokuWiki Interfaces may not work well with ''ComboStrap''.

If this is the case and that you got your installation not working anymore, the fix is:
  * to rename on your server the directory ''dokuwiki/lib/plugins/combo'' to ''dokuwiki/lib/plugins/combo.old''
  * or to delete it

And to [[:support|send us the log of your webserver]] if you want us to take a look.
==== Install the Combo extension ====

  * Search for the term ''Combo''
  * Click on the ''install'' button.
