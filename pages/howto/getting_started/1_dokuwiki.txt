====== ComboStrap Getting Started - Dokuwiki Installation ======

===== About =====
Because [[:combostrap|ComboStrap]] is built on top of the [[doku>|Dokuwiki Engine]], the first step is to install it.

This page steps you through this phase of how to install Dokuwiki.


===== Steps =====



==== DokuWiki Version Check ====
If you have already a Dokuwiki Installation, you should have the last version. We support the previous version only a couple of month.

You can check the version of your installation:
  * by logging in as an admin (superuser)
  * and use the ''do=check'' parameter to your wiki's URL. Eg:
<code>
http://yourdomain/yourwiki/doku.php?do=check
</code>

You should get the following:
<code>
DokuWiki version: Release 2020-07-29 "Hogfather"
</code>

If you don't have the last version, we recommend to install the [[https://www.dokuwiki.org/plugin:upgrade|Upgrade plugin]] and to upgrade your installation.


==== Dokuwiki Installation ====

If you don't have a Dokuwiki Instance, you can install it as follow:
  * [[https://download.dokuwiki.org/|Download the last Dokuwiki]], 
  * Verify that your php server has the [[support:requirement|minimum requirements]]:
      * [[support:requirement#php|php version supported]]: ''7.4'' to ''8.2''
      * and [[support:requirement#moduleextension|php extensions]]
  * Upload the zip file to your web server 
  * Unzip it to your web directory
  * Access the installer script at ''https://yourdomain.com/install.php''
  * Answer the install form. Choose:
     * at minimal the [[doku>config:useacl|ACL option]], otherwise you get no access to the admin page
     * the `read` permission, otherwise the [[:docs:app:logo|logo]] and [[:howto:getting_started:6_favicon|favicon]] will not render
  * Done
