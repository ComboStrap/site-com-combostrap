====== How to add HTML, Css, and Javascript directly to the content of your pages? ======



===== About =====
This article shows you how you can add ''HTML'', ''CSS'', or ''Javascript'' to the content of your markup page.



===== Steps =====

==== Give permissions ====

By default and for [[:security|security reason]], only ''admin'' user can write ''HTML'' and ''Javascript'' on the page.

If you want to allow a user to write ''HTML'' and ''Javascript'', you need to add it to the [[:docs:app:designer|designer group]].

==== Use the Webcode component  ====

The [[:docs:utility:webcode|webcode component]] is a component that shows by default the output of [[:docs:block:code|code block]] that it encapsulates.

By using the ''inject'' type, you can write the content of these ''HTML'', ''Css'', or ''Javascript'' block codes into your page.

==== Example ====

  * The markup
<webcode>
```dw
<webcode inject>
    <code html>
<p class="webcode-injected lead mb-4">Quickly design and customize responsive mobile-first sites with ComboStrap, 
a front-end toolkit, based on text markup files with responsive design, and powerful components.</p>
    </code>
    <code css>
.webcode-injected {
   font-weight: bold;
}
    </code>
</webcode>
```

  * The Output:
</webcode>
