====== Support CKGEdit ======


===== About =====
The ''CKGEdit plugin'' is a [[plugin|external plugin]] that replaces the dokuwiki editor.


===== Not all syntaxes plugin are supported by CkgEdit =====

By default, the ''CKGEdit'' plugin does not handle plugins and returns the Dokuwiki syntax.
This behavior unfortunately means that not all syntaxes are supported.

Below, you can see the known effects but there may be more.

==== DokuWiki Heading ====

Because we take over the dokuwiki heading, ''CKGEdit'' will then return:
  * ''%%====== Title ======%%''
  * and not ''%%<h1>Title</h1>%%''

If you want to use ''CKGEdit'':
  * you need to [[docs:content:heading#headingWikiEnable|disable the dokuwiki heading]]
  * you can not use the [[docs:content:heading|combo heading syntax]]

==== Frontmatter ====
''CkgEdit'' is not compatible with the [[:docs:metadata:frontmatter|frontmatter]].
It will see it as text and inject it into the HTML.

===== Code details =====

The code responsible for this behavior is in [[https://github.com/turnermm/ckgedit/blob/master/action/edit.php#L1173|the action/edit.php file, line 1173]].
<code php>
foreach ( $instructions as $instruction ) {
	 if ($instruction[0] == 'plugin') {
		$Renderer->doc .= $instruction[1][3]; // here
  } else {
	   call_user_func_array(array(&$Renderer, $instruction[0]),$instruction[1]);
  }
}
