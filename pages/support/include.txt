====== Support  - Include Plugin ======


===== About =====
The ''include plugin'' is a [[plugin|external plugin]] that permits to compose a page with the content of another page.


===== Section Syntax =====
The [[doku>plugin:include|include plugin]] permits to add the content of a section with the following syntax.

<code>
{{section>reference#section}}
</code>

By default, the section syntax will not work with ComboStrap, you need to disable the [[docs:content:heading#headingWikiEnable|combo wiki heading component]].

<note>
It does not work because the ''include plugin'' uses the standard dokuwiki heading to be able to extract the content.
