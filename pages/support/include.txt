====== Support  - Include Plugin ======


===== About =====
The ''include plugin'' is a [[plugin|external plugin]] that permits to compose a page with the content of another page.

===== How to enable it with Combostrap? =====
By default, the include plugin (ie section syntax) will not work with ComboStrap.

You need to disable the [[docs:content:heading#headingWikiEnable|combo wiki heading component]] to enable it.

**Why?**: It does not work because the ''include plugin'' uses the standard Dokuwiki heading to be able to extract the content.


===== Example: Section Syntax =====
The [[doku>plugin:include|include plugin]] permits adding the content of a section with the following syntax.

<code>
{{section>reference#section}}
</code>


===== Support =====


==== Why an included Heading 1 does not appear? ====

If your page has a [[:docs:theme:template:template|template]] with a [[:docs:theme:slot:main_header_slot|main header]], the [[:docs:content:heading|heading]] ''1'' is captured to not show the title twice.

If you need to include an ''heading 1'' in a Combostrap page, see this [[https://github.com/ComboStrap/combo/issues/91#issuecomment-2041409876|comment]]
