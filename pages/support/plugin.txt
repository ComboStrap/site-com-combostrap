====== ComboStrap - Third Party Plugin ======


===== About =====
This page regroups all support information about external plugins.

ie:
  * if the plugin is supported and tested against ComboStrap
  * or any extra informations needed


===== List =====

==== Move ====

The [[docs:page:move|move plugin]] is a core plugin of ComboStrap that we support and test fully.

See [[docs:page:move]]


==== Search Index Manager ====

We support support the ''search index manager'' plugin. For more information, you can see the dedicated page. [[:docs:utility:search_index_manager]]
==== Cache ====
If you have an inconsistent page, you may have a cache issue. The [[doku>plugin:stale]] permits to make the whole cache stale in one click.

You access it as action in the [[docs:layout:page:railbar|railbar]]

{{howto:getting_started:stale_plugin_rail_action.png|}}
==== Google Analytics ====

If you want some analytics information on your page, you can use the following Google plugin:
  * [[docs:analytics:google_analytics|Google Analytics]]
  * [[doku>plugin:googletagmanager|Google Tag Manager]]

You can configure your tag id via the [[doku>plugin:config|configuration manager]] available via the ''admin'' action of the [[docs:layout:page:railbar|railbar]]

{{howto:getting_started:admin_railbar.png|}}


==== ImageMapping ====

If you want to use [[doku>plugin:imagemapping]] with ComboStrap, you should not put a link or image in a list.

**Not Allowed**
The below example on the documentation will not work.
<code dw>
{{map>support:imagemap.png|Alternate Text}}
Type normal wiki markup here. Links will be automatically
detected and used in the image map.
  * [[imagemap#Syntax|Description @ 10,12,40,30]]
  * [[wp>Image_map|An interwiki link @ 110,50,40]]
  * [[http://w3.org/|{{w3c-logo.png|Even image links work @10,115,80,95,150,115,80,135}}]]
  * {{w3c-logo.png|Direct link to a media file @155,90,244,142}}
{{<map}}
</code>

**Allowed/Corrected**
You need to put the links / image at the beginning of a new line
<webcode name="Default" frameborder="0">
<code dw>
{{map>support:imagemap.png|Alternate Text}}
Type normal wiki markup here. Links will be automatically
detected and used in the image map.
[[support:imagemap#Syntax|Description @ 10,12,40,30]]
[[wp>Image_map|An interwiki link @ 110,50,40]]
[[http://w3.org/|{{w3c-logo.png|Even image links work @10,115,80,95,150,115,80,135}}]]
{{w3c-logo.png|Direct link to a media file @155,90,244,142}}
{{<map}}
</code>
The output will be:
</webcode>

<note>
=== Why ? ===
Because we allow [[docs:content:link|link]] to be on a list. The image mapping plugin will then process our link and will not see any standard dokuwiki link.
</note>


**Automatic test not supported**

We test manually but we cannot test automatically because the imagemapping plugin fails the tests in Continuous Integration.

To be more detailed, the imagemapping plugin has created php file with HTML content  in the [[https://github.com/i-net-software/dokuwiki-plugin-imagemap/tree/master/_test/jstests|jstests directory]]. It causes the build to fail with with the following error:
<file>
Cannot modify header information - headers already sent by (output started at /home/travis/build/doku/lib/plugins/imagemapping/_test/jstests/ImageMapTest.php:1)
</file>


==== Plugin description ====


If a [[docs:page:description|description]] was set with the [[doku>plugin:description|description plugin]] and that ComboStrap does not have any description set, we use it as the description.

<note>
Note that any changes made to the description via the [[docs:metadata:manager|metadata manager]] will update the standard description field, not the description of the [[doku>plugin:description|description plugin]].
</note>

==== Include ====

The [[include|include plugin]] does not work out of the box, you need to disable the heading functionality.

For more information, we invite you to go to the dedicated page. [[include]].

==== CkgEdit ====

The [[ckdedit|ckdedit plugin]] works only with dokuwiki heading, you need then to disable the heading functionality.

For more information, we invite you to go to the dedicated page. [[ckdedit]].

==== Typography ====


We have a conflict with the old text syntax ''typo'' that is also used by the [[doku>plugin:typography|typography plugin]].
We have resolve it by taking over with our equivalent component: [[docs:block:text|text]]

The easy fix is to switch over.

If you can't and that this is a problem for you, [[:support|contact us]].

==== Edittable ====

The [[doku>plugin:edittable|edittable plugin]] permits to edit table graphically.

Combostrap supports it.
