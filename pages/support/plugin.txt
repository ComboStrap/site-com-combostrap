====== ComboStrap - Third Party Plugin ======


===== About =====
This page regroups all support information about external plugins.

ie:
  * if the plugin is supported and tested against ComboStrap
  * or any extra informations needed 


===== List =====

==== Move ====

The [[doku>plugin:move]] plugin is a core plugin of ComboStrap and allows the move of:
  * [[docs:content:link|link in the page]]
  * [[docs:content:image|image in the page]]
  * [[docs:semantic:image|image declared in the metadata]]

By using ''ComboStrap'' if your [[#searchindex|index]] is up-to-date, you will not have any [[docs:quality:broken_link|broken link]]


==== ImageMapping ====

If you want to use [[doku>plugin:imagemapping]] with ComboStrap, you should not put the link on a list.

**Not Allowed**
Which means that the example on the documentation will not work.
<code dw>
{{map>media_link|Alternate Text}}

Type normal wiki markup here. Links will be automatically detected and used in the image map.

  * [[wikipage|Description @ 10,12,40,30]]
  * [[wp>image_map|An interwiki link @ 110,50,40]]
  * [[http://w3c.org/|{{w3c_logo.png|Even image links work @10,115,80,95,150,115,80,135}}]]
{{<map}}
</code>

**Allowed**
You need to put the links on a line
<code dw>
{{map>media_link|Alternate Text}}

Type normal wiki markup here. Links will be automatically detected and used in the image map.

[[wikipage|Description @ 10,12,40,30]]
[[wp>image_map|An interwiki link @ 110,50,40]]
[[http://w3c.org/|{{w3c_logo.png|Even image links work @10,115,80,95,150,115,80,135}}]]
{{<map}}
</code>

<note>
=== Why ? ===
Because we allow [[docs:content:link|link]] to be on a list. The image mapping plugin will then process our link and will not see any standard dokuwiki link.
