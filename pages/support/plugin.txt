====== ComboStrap - Third Party Plugin ======


===== About =====
This page regroups all support information about external plugins.

ie:
  * if the plugin is supported and tested against ComboStrap
  * or any extra informations needed 


===== List =====

==== Move ====

The [[doku>plugin:move]] plugin is a core plugin of ComboStrap.

For each page move, we:
  * rename the [[docs:content:link|page link]]
  * rename the [[docs:content:image|image link]] and [[docs:page_meta:image|page image]]
  * take into account the [[docs:navigation:backlink|backlink]]
  * and [[docs:analytics:replication|replicate]] the change in the database

By using ''ComboStrap'' if your [[#searchindex|index]] is up-to-date, you will not have any [[docs:quality:broken_link|broken link]]


You can quickly move a page with the ''rename'' action in the [[docs:layout:page:railbar|railbar]].

==== Search Index Manager ====

The ''search index'' is an index of your page that powers the [[docs:menubar:search|search component]] and stores the [[docs:navigation:related|backlinks]].

The index is [[doku>search|updated]] incrementally page by page when a visitor see a page.

If you change a lot of page (for instance, making a release), the [[doku>plugin:searchindex|search index manager]] is for you. It will rebuild the index completely. 

<note>
The [[#move]] plugins depends on it to retrieve the backlinks.

If you don't want to create [[docs:quality:broken_link|broken links]] don't forget to rebuild your index if you have added pages externally (ie moved from an other installation via the file system, not via the web interface)
</note>

You access it on the admin page via the ''admin'' action of the [[docs:layout:page:railbar|railbar]]

==== Cache ====
If you have an inconsistent page, you may have a cache issue. The [[doku>plugin:stale]] permits to make the whole cache stale in one click.

You access it as action in the [[docs:layout:page:railbar|railbar]]

{{:docs:getting_started:stale_plugin_rail_action.png|}}
==== Analytics ====

If you want some analytics information on your page, you can use the following Google plugin:
  * [[doku>plugin:googleanalytics|Google Analtyics]]
  * [[doku>plugin:googletagmanager|Google Tag Manager]]

You can configure your tag id via the [[doku>plugin:config|configuration manager]] available via the ''admin'' action of the [[docs:layout:page:railbar|railbar]]

==== ImageMapping ====

If you want to use [[doku>plugin:imagemapping]] with ComboStrap, you should not put a link or image in a list.

**Not Allowed**
The below example on the documentation will not work.
<code dw>
{{map>imagemap.png|Alternate Text}}
Type normal wiki markup here. Links will be automatically 
detected and used in the image map.
  * [[imagemap#Syntax|Description @ 10,12,40,30]]
  * [[wp>Image_map|An interwiki link @ 110,50,40]]
  * [[http://w3.org/|{{w3c-logo.png|Even image links work @10,115,80,95,150,115,80,135}}]]
  * {{w3c-logo.png|Direct link to a media file @155,90,244,142}}
{{<map}}
</code>

**Allowed/Corrected**
You need to put the links / image at the beginning of a new line
<webcode name="Default" frameborder="0">
<code dw>
{{map>imagemap.png|Alternate Text}}
Type normal wiki markup here. Links will be automatically 
detected and used in the image map.
[[imagemap#Syntax|Description @ 10,12,40,30]]
[[wp>Image_map|An interwiki link @ 110,50,40]]
[[http://w3.org/|{{w3c-logo.png|Even image links work @10,115,80,95,150,115,80,135}}]]
{{w3c-logo.png|Direct link to a media file @155,90,244,142}}
{{<map}}
</code>
The output will be:
</webcode>

<note>
=== Why ? ===
Because we allow [[docs:content:link|link]] to be on a list. The image mapping plugin will then process our link and will not see any standard dokuwiki link.
</note>


**Automatic test not supported**

We test manually but we cannot test automatically because the imagemapping plugin fails the tests in Continuous Integration.

To be more detailed, the imagemapping plugin has created php file with HTML content  in the [[https://github.com/i-net-software/dokuwiki-plugin-imagemap/tree/master/_test/jstests|jstests directory]]. It causes the build to fail with with the following error:
<file>
Cannot modify header information - headers already sent by (output started at /home/travis/build/doku/lib/plugins/imagemapping/_test/jstests/ImageMapTest.php:1)
</file>
