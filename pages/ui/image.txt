====== ComboStrap UI - Images ======

===== About =====
''image'' is a [[block|block UI Component]] that permits to show [[raster|raster]] or [[svg|svg]] images from your media library in your pages 



===== Articles Related =====
{{backlinks>.}}

===== Features =====


All images are:
  * [[:lazy|lazy loaded]] by default to enhance [[:performance|performance]]
  * ''Automatic resizing'' (or ''responsive'') 
      * for [[svg|svg images]], we set extra responsive properties.
      * for [[raster|raster images]],  a small screen will receive a small image while a big screen will receive the biggest image. For more information, see [[raster#automatic_responsive_resizing|Raster - Automatic Resizing]]

===== Supported Image Type =====
''ComboStrap'' supports:
  * [[raster|raster image]]
  * and [[svg|svg image]]


===== Syntax =====

ComboStrap uses:
  * the same syntax than [[doku>wiki:syntax#media_files|Dokuwiki]]
  * extended with the [[styling:styling|styling attributes]]

<code dw>
{{[ ]path?WxH&att=value[ ]}}
</code>
where:
  * ''path'' is:
      * for an internal image: the internal path of the dokuwiki
      * for an external image: the URL.
  * ''W'' is the width (0 is not supported)
  * ''H'' is the height (Optional)
  * ''[ ]'' are optional spaces that indicates the alignement of the image (left or right)
  * ''att=value'' is one or more [[styling:styling|styling attributes]]



===== Example =====

==== Resize to a given width ====

To resize to a given width, add a number.

Example of the image resized to ''400px''
<webcode name="Default" frameborder="0">
<code dw>
{{:ui:stock_image_surfer_in_the_see.png?400|}}
</code>
</webcode>





Resizing to a given height is not needed because the image are by default responsive and will adapt to their container. Therefore, setting an height is not supported.

<note>
Raster images are automatically resized below the screen size. For more information, see the [[raster#automatic_responsive_resizing|Raster - Automatic Resizing feature]]
</note>

==== Align  ====


  * To align to the right (ie float), let a space at the left
  * To align to the left, let no space, this is the default
  * To align to the center, let a space at the left and at the right

Example: align the image to the right with:
  * a width of 300
  * a [[styling:color|background-color of white]]
  * and a padding of 3 (''p-3'') with [[styling:spacing|spacing]]
<webcode name="Default" frameborder="0">
<code dw>
{{ :ui:stock_image_surfer_in_the_see.png?300&spacing=p-3&background-color=white|}}
</code>
</webcode>

<note>
  * If you want more control on position, we advise you to use the [[ui:grid|grid]] and its columns.
  * The ''align'' parameter applies the same effect than the [[styling:align#block|align attribute for a component]]
</note>


==== Styling Attributes ====

You can style even further your image with [[styling:styling|styling element]]:
  * with a [[styling:shadow|shadow elevation through styling]].
  * with a [[styling:hover|hover float effect]]

For instance, to elevate this photography with a surfer, you could use this syntax.

<webcode name="Default" frameborder=0>
<code dw>
{{ :ui:stock_image_surfer_in_the_see.png?400&onHover=float&shadow=lg |}}
</code>
</webcode>
