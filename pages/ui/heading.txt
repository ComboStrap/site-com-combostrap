====== ComboStrap UI - Heading ======


===== About =====
''headings'' has two different function:
  * the first one is ''structural'' and generates the structure (section) of the document. The table of content (TOC) is created from this structure.
  * the second one is ''semantic'' and defines the title of a component.

This is important to not mixed the two, this is why we have two different articles. See:
  * the [[sectioning|sectioning page]] for structural heading
  * the [[title|title page]] for semantic heading.
