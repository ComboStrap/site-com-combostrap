====== ComboStrap UI Styling ======


===== About =====
''Styling'' in ''ComboStrap'' is the possibility to render every [[ui:ui|component]] as you wish.

''ComboStrap'' has three levels of styling:
  * the [[#bootstrap stylesheet|bootstrap stylesheet level]] - bootstrap standard theme
  * the [[#user_stylesheet|user stylesheet level]] - a stylesheet with custom rule to tune the styling precisely
  * the [[#attribute level]] - inline css customization
      * [[#standard|standard]] - a set of the most important attributes to quickly style any components.
      * and [[#advanced|advanced]] which let's you use the full power of HTML and CSS.

===== Levels =====

==== Bootstrap Stylesheet ====

''ComboStrap'' is based on ''Bootstrap'' and comes with pre-packaged stylesheets. You can even create and install your own bootstrap stylesheet.

==== User Stylesheet ====

This functionality gives the possibility to the web designer to create their own CSS rules in a custom stylesheet in order to tune the theme exactly to their needs.

==== Attributes ====

=== Standard  ===
The ''standard'' attributes are:
  * [[styling:dimension|Dimension (Width and height)]] - Take control of the space
  * [[styling:align|Align]] - Align your component and their text as you wish
  * [[styling:spacing|Spacing]] - Master your layout at the pixel-perfect details
  * [[color|Color]] - Text, Border and Background color made easy with name and declarative gradient
  * [[skin|Skin]] - Apply a skin to control the emphasis level of your components
  * [[styling:shadow]]|Elevation]] - Add a shadow and elevate your component

<note>
=== For the Geek ===
''Standard attributes'' are all transformed into [[style|CSS rules]].
</note>


=== Advanced ===
Every component is a [[styling:html|html superset]] and you can therefore use the HTML attributes:
  * [[class|class]]
  * and [[style|style]]
for advanced styling
