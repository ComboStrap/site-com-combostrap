===== Changes =====

==== New ====
  * Added the https://arcticons.com/ [[docs:content:icon|icon library]]
  * The [[docs:content:page-image|page image]] is taking the image of the parent page if the page does not have any image
  * The ''txt'' mime is now authorized by default.
  * In a [[docs:layout:component:grid|grid]], a ''cell'' now supports the [[docs:styling:clickable|clickable attribute]]
  * A ''grid'' is now supported in a [[docs:templating:iterator|iterator]].
  * The [[docs:navigation:toc|Table Of Content]] is no more attached to the [[docs:utility:renderer|renderer]] and can now be placed inside the page via the toc component.
  * The [[docs:layout:page:slot_manager|slot manager]] was added in the [[docs:layout:page:railbar|railbar]] to help create and localize [[docs:layout:page:slot|slots]].
  * The toggle functionality has been rewritten. The [[:docs:animation:toggle|toggle element]] is new and allows to set the a different control if the target is expanded or collapsed.
  * The [[:docs:app:identity|Identity form code]] is now ready for the new [[https://github.com/ComboStrap/combo/issues/14|DokuWiki version]].
  * A [[docs:layout:page:container#defaultLayoutContainer|default layout container]] is now used to set:
      * the whole template layout horizontal alignement
      * the default value of container aware component such as [[:docs:menubar:menubar|Menubar]]
  * The [[:docs:navigation:page-explorer|Page explorer]] component will collapse on small device due to the default [[:docs:animation:toggle|toggle-state]] value.
  * The informational messages are now toast located in the center of the page.
  * The [[:docs:styling:hero|Hero]] attribute that permits to create easily an hero unit style content.
  * The [[:docs:layout:component:grid|row component]] accepts the ratio unit (percentage and fraction) as width length on its cells.
==== Modification ====
Because of too much confusion, the following name has been renamed:
  * The ''home page'' is now known as the [[docs:type:index|index page]]
  * The ''root page'' is now known as the [[docs:app:home|home page]] 


The [[:docs:layout:component:grid|row component]] is no more called a grid in the documentation because this is a layout component that works only on one axis and not two. It was just renamed to row.
==== Improvement ====

  * When [[support:preserve|preserve style]] is set on svg, the svg is shown as an img to avoid style conflict.
  * The [[docs:content:svg|big svg image]] served via an image tag can now be defined in other unit than ''px''.
  * [[docs:router:bestendpagename|Best end page name]]: when two pages with the same score are found, the page with the highest number of backlinks is returned.
  * In a [[docs:menubar:brand|brand]] with icon, label and link widget, the icon does not participate in the link to not have a visual line caused by the underline style between the text and the icon.
  * The [[:docs:utility:link_wizard|Link Wizard]] was modified to show only pages. It will not group pages by namespace as dokuwiki does by default. 
  * The [[:docs:utility:prism|prism components]] (console, file, code) load their stylesheet with the page and no more via javascript leading to the suppression of a layout shift.
  * Added dependatbot. [[https://github.com/ComboStrap/combo/issues/28|issues 28]]
  * The media manager styling has been improved (the ''select file'' is now a button and the file has been renamed from file uploader to media manager)
  * The [[:docs:menubar:fixed-top|Fixed Top Menubar]]:
      * was causing a small layout shift that has been corrected.
      * uses another method (scroll-margin-top) to shift the location of the heading text when navigating/scrolling
  * The railbar when overflowing was not giving the possibility to scroll the items.
  * If a page was copied with a frontmatter without deleting the page id, the page would have become a duplicate in the database.
==== Deprecated ====
  * The [[:release:deprecated:toggle|toggleTargetId]] has been deprecated for the [[:docs:animation:toggle|Toggle element]].
  * The ''align'' attribute in the [[:docs:menubar:menubar|menubar]] has been replaced by a [[docs:layout:page:container|container attribute value]]
  * The [[:release:deprecated:footer|footer component]] and the [[release:deprecated:slide|slide component]] are deprecated and replaced by the [[:docs:layout:component:bar|bar component]].
  * Edit Button for slot has been deprecated for the [[:docs:layout:page:slot_manager|Slot Manager]]
  * The [[:release:deprecated:container|container syntax component]] has been deprecated for [[docs:layout:page:container|container aware components]]
==== Bug ====
  * The [[docs:app:search|Internal Search Engine]] result was not going away if the escape click reaches no element.
  * When the [[docs:performance:frontend_optimization|Front End Optimization]] was on, the [[docs:app:search|Internal Search Engine]] was no more working because ''DOKU_BASE'' was no more present.
  * Template version was not checked when the class was already loaded via php-fpm. When [[release:update|upgrading]] combostrap, due to version conflict, the upgrade would crash. The documentation was change and there is now a check each time.
  * The [[docs:templating:sql|page sql backlink]] did not add a dependency on the requested page.
  * When used in a slot, the snippet of the carrousel could be missing. The bug was that the snippets were stored by slot and not by rendered page. As a carrousel can show a grid or a carrousel that depends on the number of items, the last page rendered was overwriting the snippets. If a page rendered add few backlinks, the carrousel was a grid and the carrousel glide javascript was no more present for the other page from the cache. The snippets cache now should have the same key cache than the rendered slot.
  * The [[docs:router:message|redirection message]] was printed at the end of the page. We test now that it's the first child of the main content.
  * The first image was not updated correctly. A bad condition mades the first image to stay for the first [[docs:content:svg|svg]] found.
  * Two [[docs:content:highlight|markdown highlights]] on the same line would highlight also the content in-between.
  * The [[docs:router:bestendpagename|Best End Page Name Algorithm]] was not returning the best page but the first one with a score of 1. There was therefore no permanent redirect.
  * The [[:docs:utility:prism|prism component]] (code, console, file) didn't have the ''copy'' button. The migration to a new version has forgotten the copy plugin and there was a version mismatch between the plugin and prism. This is corrected.
  * The [[:docs:content:inote|Inote]] was not wrapping, making the width of windows overflowing.
  * The requested path was not always correct when a [[:docs:page:url|permanent page url]] was used because the first event of dokuwiki (load lang) was checking the last name of the url path and not the last part of the name
