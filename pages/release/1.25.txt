=== Breaking: We don't support php 7.2 and 7.3 ===

Due to a bug in our dependencies, we have upgraded them and they are only available from 7.4.

Because 7.2 and 7.3 are already end of life, we have taken the decision to upgrade.

==== Modification ====
Because of too much confusion, the following name has been renamed:
  * The ''home page'' is now known as the [[docs:type:index|index page]]
  * The ''root page'' is now known as the [[docs:app:home|home page]]


The [[docs:layout:component:grid|Row component]] is now called a grid because:
  * the children may be laid out on more than one line
  * you can define gutter between the children

==== Breaking ====
  * The suffix for the class is now ''cs'' for combostrap. It's smaller than ''combo'' and uses the same convention than bootstrap with ''bs''.
  * We support only php 7.4 (due to our dependencies), up to 8 (due to dokuwiki). More information, in the [[:support:requirement#php|requirement page]]
==== Improvement ====

  * When [[support:preserve|preserve style]] is set on svg, the svg is shown as an img to avoid style conflict.
  * The [[docs:content:svg|big svg image]] served via an image tag can now be defined in other unit than ''px''.
  * [[docs:router:bestendpagename|Best end page name]]: when two pages with the same score are found, the page with the highest number of backlinks is returned.
  * In a [[docs:menubar:brand|brand]] with icon, label and link widget, the icon does not participate in the link to not have a visual line caused by the underline style between the text and the icon.
  * The [[:docs:utility:link_wizard|Link Wizard]] was modified to show only pages. It will not group pages by namespace as dokuwiki does by default.
  * The [[:docs:utility:prism|prism components]] (console, file, code) load their stylesheet with the page and no more via javascript leading to the suppression of a layout shift and to a faster page load.
  * Added dependatbot. [[https://github.com/ComboStrap/combo/issues/28|issues 28]]
  * The media manager styling has been improved (the ''select file'' is now a button and the file has been renamed from file uploader to media manager)
  * The [[:docs:menubar:fixed-top|Fixed Top Menubar]]:
      * was causing a small layout shift that has been corrected.
      * uses another method (scroll-margin-top) to shift the location of the heading text when navigating/scrolling
  * The railbar when overflowing was not giving the possibility to scroll the items.
  * If a page was copied with a frontmatter without deleting the page id, the page would have become a duplicate in the database.
  * The [[:docs:lists:content-list|Content List]] component allows now any component as child.
  * The edit/preview styling has been revamped
      * the textarea was not a [[https://datacadamia.com/data/type/text/font_monospace|fixed pitch font]] making the calculation of space difficult to spot.
      * button have been made bootstrap flat style
      * bottom margin has been added between the line of component
  * Javascript improvement:
      * browser test have been added
      * the package version range allows now the minor upgrade to get the security update
  * The [[:docs:utility:webcode|webcode]] component loads now its javascript and stylesheet with the [[:docs:cache:static|Infinite Static Cache]].
  * The [[:docs:utility:webcode|Webcode]] component overwrites the console in the head, overwriting also the console script in the HTML content.
  * The [[:docs:content:link#external|external links]] in a [[:docs:menubar:menubar|Menubar]] are styled correctly now.
  * The class loader now uses the autoloader features of composer.
  * The [[:docs:menubar:search|search box]] suggestion list is now cleared when the search box or a suggestion list items loose focus. The code is modular and tested.
  * The button of the edit toolbar in the edit form are now styled 

==== Deprecated ====
  * The [[:release:deprecated:toggle|toggleTargetId]] has been deprecated for the [[:docs:animation:toggle|Toggle element]].
  * The ''align'' attribute in the [[:docs:menubar:menubar|menubar]] has been replaced by a [[docs:layout:page:container|container attribute value]]
  * The [[:release:deprecated:footer|footer component]] and the [[release:deprecated:slide|slide component]] are deprecated and replaced by the [[:docs:layout:component:bar|bar component]].

      * A grid layout accepts now any children
      * The css flex system is now applied via the [[:docs:styling:align|Align attribute]] / [[:docs:styling:dimension|width grow/shrink]]
  * The [[:release:deprecated:date|date component]] has been deprecated for the [[:docs:templating:pipeline#format|Pipeline Format function]].
  * The [[:release:deprecated:text-align|text-align attribute]] has been deprecated for the [[:docs:styling:align|align attribute]]


==== Bug ====
  * The [[docs:app:search|Internal Search Engine]] result was not going away if the escape click reaches no element.
  * When the [[docs:performance:frontend_optimization|Front End Optimization]] was on, the [[docs:app:search|Internal Search Engine]] was no more working because ''DOKU_BASE'' was no more present.
  * Template version was not checked when the class was already loaded via php-fpm. When [[release:update|upgrading]] combostrap, due to version conflict, the upgrade would crash. The documentation was change and there is now a check each time.
  * The [[docs:templating:sql|page sql backlink]] did not add a dependency on the requested page.
  * When used in a slot, the snippet of the carrousel could be missing. The bug was that the snippets were stored by slot and not by rendered page. As a carrousel can show a grid or a carrousel that depends on the number of items, the last page rendered was overwriting the snippets. If a page rendered add few backlinks, the carrousel was a grid and the carrousel glide javascript was no more present for the other page from the cache. The snippets cache now should have the same key cache than the rendered slot.
  * The [[docs:router:message|redirection message]] was printed at the end of the page. We test now that it's the first child of the main content.
  * The first image was not updated correctly. A bad condition mades the first image to stay for the first [[docs:content:svg|svg]] found.
  * Two [[docs:content:highlight|markdown highlights]] on the same line would highlight also the content in-between.
  * The [[docs:router:bestendpagename|Best End Page Name Algorithm]] was not returning the best page but the first one with a score of 1. There was therefore no permanent redirect.
  * The [[:docs:utility:prism|prism component]] (code, console, file) didn't have the ''copy'' button. The migration to a new version has forgotten the copy plugin and there was a version mismatch between the plugin and prism. This is corrected.
  * The [[:docs:content:inote|Inote]] was not wrapping, making the width of windows overflowing.
  * The requested path was not always correct when a [[:docs:page:url|permanent page url]] was used because the first event of dokuwiki (load lang) was checking the last name of the url path and not the last part of the name
  * admin page were having no toc. Why ? because the admin page may have a toc defined by the plugin. Strap template uses now the default dokuwiki function to render admin page being completely compatible.
  * the [[:docs:menubar:dropdown|dropdown]] component was broken in Bootstrap 5 because it didn't had the bootstrap prefix. Error was the here doc was using the javascript notation and not the php notation.
