====== Deprecated - Page Images Metadata ======


===== Replacement =====
The ''images'' metadata has been replaced by:
  * [[:docs:page:featured-image|featured image]]
  * [[:docs:social:twitter|twitter image]]
  * [[:docs:social:facebook|facebook image]]


===== Why? =====
  * It was too complicated for the user to get a grasp of which image would be used for which usage.
  * It was not possible to see the default usage value.

The first idea was to be able to upload a bunch of image with different ratio and to choose the best but it's not following the ''kiss'' principle.


===== Old documentation =====

''image'' is a [[docs:metadata:metadata|page metadata]] that defines an illustrative [[docs:content:image|image]] for the page.




===== Usage =====

==== Page Image ====

The image can be rendered with the [[docs:content:page-image|page-image component]] in:
      * a [[:slot_main_header|main content header]]
      * or [[:docs:templating:iterator|iterator]]

Example for this page:
<webcode name="Default" frameborder="0">
  * The markup
<code dw>
<page-image width="300px"/>
</code>
  * The output:
</webcode>

==== Social ====
The image is added into [[docs:social:social|social]] cards such as [[docs:social:twitter|twitter]], [[docs:social:google|google]] or [[docs:social:facebook|facebook]].


===== How to set the images from the page ? =====

The recommended images are:
   * high-resolution (minimum of 300,000 pixels when multiplying ''width'' and ''height'', to avoid blurry, unclear images)
   * with the following aspect ratios: ''16x9'', ''4x3'', and ''1x1'' (to avoid [[docs:content:image#cropping|cropping]])

==== Metadata Manager ====

You can set the path of your image in the [[docs:metadata:manager|metadata manager]].

{{:docs:page:page_image_metadata_manager.png?0x400|}}

==== You can't upload from the metadata manager ====

Note that you can't upload the images with the metadata manager for now, therefore:
  * you need to upload your image while editing first (note that the first image in your page is by default the page image).
  * or you can edit the [[docs:metadata:frontmatter|frontmatter]] directly.

**Frontmatter example:**
  * Single Image
<code json>
{
    "image": ":photos:1x1:photo.jpg"
}
</code>
  * Multiple:
<code json>
{
    "image": [
         ":photos:1x1:photo.jpg",
         ":photos:4x3:photo.jpg",
         ":photos:16x9:photo.jpg"
    ]
}
</code>

<note>
Moving image path with the [[support:plugin#move|move plugin]] will update their path.
