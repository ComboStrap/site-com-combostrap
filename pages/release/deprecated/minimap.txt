====== ComboStrap UI - Minimap ======

===== About =====
<note important>
The ''minimap'' has been deprecated. You should use the [[ui:ntoc|ntoc component]] instead if you want to list the pages of a namespace.
</note>

It's still usable for compatibility reason.


This component supports also the [[quality:lqpp|low quality page protection]] and does not show the ''low quality page'' when protected.


===== Example =====

  * A basic minimap ([[https://github.com/gerardnico/dokuwiki-plugin-minimap|syntax]])
<webcode name="Default" frameborder=0 width=100% scrolling=yes externalResources="," renderingMode=story >
<code dw>
<minimap suppress="ComboStrap UI -">
</code>
  * The output:
</webcode>
