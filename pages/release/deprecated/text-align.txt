====== ComboStrap Styling - Text Align Attribute ======


===== About =====
''text-align'' has been deprecated for the [[:docs:styling:align|align attribute]].

===== Why ? =====
Because it permits to have a central attribute where all alignments possibility are defined.

It was unclear for user to set a ''align=center'' and to see no effect while they were asking for a ''text-center''.
