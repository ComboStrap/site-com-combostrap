====== Deprecated - Hierarchical Breadcrumb in renderer ======

<note warning>
=== Deprecation Notice ===
With the advent of the [[:slot_main_header|main slot header]], the user can choose to add or not the breadcrumb in it.
Therefore, the breadcrumb via the [[docs:utility:renderer|renderer]] is deprecated.

See the new  [[docs:navigation:hierarchical_breadcrumb|Hierarchical Breadcrumb]].
</note>
