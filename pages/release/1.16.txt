====== ComboStrap - Release 1.16 ======

===== List =====
  * New: login form
  * New register form
  * The option to span multiple line is no more supported for a [[ui:link|link]] to preserve the parse tree. See error below.
  * Bug: A [[ui:link|link]] not closed (without '']]'') followed by a closed link was making the parse tree not even and caused parsing issue on [[ui:heading|heading]] and other traversal.
  * rename: ''collapse'' has been renamed to [[ui:toggle|toggle]]
  * New: [[ui:toggle|toggle]] allows [[ui:link|link]] as control element.
  * Bug: [[ui:slide|slide]] had no padding on small screen
  * New: You can set the scroll mechanism to [[styling:dimension##toggle_scroll|toggle]] on a [[styling:dimension#height|constrained height box]]. It works also with any [[styling:prism#constrained by height|prism component]] such as [[ui:code|code]], [[ui:file|file]], [[ui:console|console]]
