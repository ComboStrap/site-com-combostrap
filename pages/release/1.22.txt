====== ComboStrap - Release 1.22 ======



===== List of changes =====

==== New ====
  * The [[docs:page:home|home]] page attribute ''is_home'' in order to be able to select the home pages within [[docs:templating:sql|page sql]]


==== Bug ====
  * After a change in the [[docs:performance:svg_optimization|svg optimization]], the svg shown will not refresh. Cause: The [[docs:cache:static|static cache]] ''buster'' was using the time of the original SVG file and not from the optimized file.
  * Not able to navigate to an heading from a link fragment for a [[docs:content:link#internal|internal link]]. Bug: the fragment was not qualified as fully section id (letting spaces in it)
