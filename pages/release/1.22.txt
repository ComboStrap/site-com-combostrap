====== ComboStrap - Release 1.22 ======



===== List of changes =====

==== New ====
  * The [[docs:page:home|home]] page attribute ''is_home'' in order to be able to select the home pages within [[docs:templating:sql|page sql]]
  * The [[docs:content:link#enableenhancedlinkwizard|enhanced link wizard]] to search also on path, title, heading and name of a page.
  * [[docs:templating:sql|Page SQL]] can now return [[docs:navigation:backlink|backlink pages]]
  * ''references between pages'' (ie [[docs:content:link|link]] and [[docs:navigation:backlink|backlink]]) are now [[docs:analytics:replication|replicated]] in the [[docs:analytics:database|database]]
  * The [[docs:layout:component:grid|grid]] layout can now be used within an [[docs:templating:iterator|template iterator]]
  * [[docs:semantic:description|description]] is now loaded into the [[docs:analytics:database|database]]

==== Improvement ====
  * The [[docs:analytics:replication|data synchronization process]] is now treated as a real replication and got a ''date_synchronization'' and a [[docs:semantic:uuid|universal id]]. The synchronization is now also based on the database version file.
  * the [[docs:analytics:replication|replication table]] ''ANALYTICS_TO_REFRESH'' has been renamed to ''PAGES_TO_REPLICATE'' to get more accurate
  * the [[docs:semantic:frontmatter|frontmatter]] metadata are [[docs:analytics:replication|replicated]] directly to avoid inconsistency with the [[docs:templating:sql|page sql]]

==== Bug ====
  * After a change in the [[docs:performance:svg_optimization|svg optimization]], the svg shown will not refresh. Cause: The [[docs:cache:static|static cache]] ''buster'' was using the time of the original SVG file and not from the optimized file.
  * Not able to navigate to an heading from a link fragment for a [[docs:content:link#internal|internal link]]. Bug: the fragment was not qualified as fully section id (letting spaces in it)
