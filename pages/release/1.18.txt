====== ComboStrap - Release 1.18 ======


===== About =====


===== List =====

==== New ====
  * The [[docs:content:tooltip|tooltip]] can now have all syntax possible inside
  * A [[docs:content:tooltip|tooltip]] can be used on block as well as on text
  * A [[docs:content:link|link]] can now have a tooltip automatically created via the ''tooltip'' attribute. See [[docs:content:tooltip?tooltip|link with automatic tooltip]]
  * The [[docs:content:link#preview|preview]] attribute on [[docs:content:link|link]] will show a tooltip with the page name and description.
  * The [[docs:semantic:name|page name]] metadata was added to set a short description of a page.

==== Breaking ====
  * With the advent of the [[docs:quality:protection#robot|robot protection mode]], the [[docs:quality:protection|protection mode]] has been broken in two configurations: [[docs:seo:lqpp#protection_mode|low quality protection mode]] and [[docs:semantic:published#protection_mode|publication protection mode]]. The default value has been reset to ''ACL'', if you had another value, you should set it again.
==== Improvement ====
  * A [[docs:content:link#internal|internal link]] gets as title the [[docs:semantic:description|description]] of the target page. This way it enhances the HTML default tooltip.
  * The height of the [[docs:layout:component:fixed-top-menu|fixed-top-menu]] is now automatically set. The configuration ''heightFixedTopMenuBar'' has become obsolete.
==== Deprecated ====
  * The old [[release:deprecated:tooltip|tooltip]] syntax was deprecated for a tooltip seen as a child of a component
