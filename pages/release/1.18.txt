====== ComboStrap - Release 1.18 ======


===== About =====

This release is a [[docs:seo:seo|SEO]] focused release.

As extra, the [[docs:content:tooltip|tooltip]] component has been largely enhanced and has permitted to add the [[docs:content:link?preview#preview|preview functionality to link]].
===== List =====

==== New ====
  * The [[docs:content:tooltip|tooltip]] can now have all syntax possible inside
  * A [[docs:content:tooltip|tooltip]] can be used on block as well as on text
  * A [[docs:content:link|link]] can now have a tooltip automatically created via the ''tooltip'' attribute. See [[docs:content:tooltip?tooltip|link with automatic tooltip]]
  * The [[docs:content:link#preview|preview]] attribute on [[docs:content:link|link]] will show a tooltip with the page name and description.
  * The [[docs:page_meta:name|page name]] metadata was added to set a short description of a page.
  * You can now add the [[#highlight_words_in_the_target_page|words to highlight in a link]] when navigating to a page.

==== Breaking ====
  * With the advent of the [[docs:quality:protection#robot|robot protection mode]], the [[docs:quality:protection|protection mode]] has been broken in two configurations: [[docs:seo:lqpp#protection_mode|low quality protection mode]] and [[docs:page_meta:published#protection_mode|publication protection mode]]. The default value has been reset to ''ACL'', if you had another value, you should set it again.
==== Improvement ====
  * A [[docs:content:link#internal|internal link]] gets as title the [[docs:page_meta:description|description]] of the target page. This way it enhances the HTML default tooltip.
  * The height of the [[docs:menubar:fixed-top|fixed-top-menu]] is now automatically set. The configuration ''heightFixedTopMenuBar'' has become obsolete.
  * The [[docs:seo:lqpp|low quality page protection]] creates now friendly SEO links, offers two more levels of protection and 3 type of links
  * The [[docs:quality:lpp|late publication protection]] and  [[docs:seo:lqpp|low quality page protection]] does not share the same [[docs:quality:protection|protection mode]]
==== Deprecated ====
  * The old [[release:deprecated:tooltip|tooltip]] syntax was deprecated for a tooltip seen as a child of a component
==== Bug ====

  * With the [[docs:page_meta:automatic_canonical|automatic canonical]], two pages with the same last two parts could get the same canonical and get this errors:
<file>
The page (viz:viz) and the page (data:viz:viz) have the same canonical. ''viz:viz''
</file>
To resolve this problem, we delete now the last name if it's the same than its previous. The page ''viz:viz'' gets the canonical ''viz'' and the page ''data:viz:viz'' gets the canonical ''data:viz''.
  * The windows share link was broken. ''\\share'' became ''\\\\share'' due to the new mandatory string transformation. A string is no more transformed as string.
