==== Security ====

==== Markup perfect ====
Markup perfect means that there is no need to tweak the output via styling.

  * Improvement: Placing a [[ui:button|button]] in a [[ui:menubar|navbar]] does not require any [[styling:spacing|spacing]] attribute. The [[ui:button|button]] spacing is automatically created.
  * New: ''Edit'' button have been added for [[ui:card|card]], [[ui:panel|panel]] and [[ui:slide|slide]] making it easier to edit them.
  * New: [[ui:text|Typo]] - the title styling class ''display-1'' to ''display-6'' are now responsive on Bootstrap 4

  * New: ''Bootstrap perfect'': We generate exactly the same markup than [[strap:bootstrap|bootstrap]]. [[ui:card|card]] and [[ui:blockquote|blockquote]] have now bootstrap paragraph with the ''text'' class making them easier to read.
  * New: Template Protection: We empty the php buffer before printing and send a message to admin user. Otherwise, plugins that print directly may mess the page completely.
  * Improvement: For boolean attributes such as ''selected'' for a [[ui:tabs|panel tab]], this is no more needed to specify the value. ie ''selected'' is equivalent to ''selected=true''
  * Improvement: A [[ui:note|note]] is now markup perfect (a stack) and accepts paragraph inside
  * New: [[styling:float|floating right]] will add a margin at the left.


==== Bug ====

  * Bug: A [[ui:link#image|image link]] points to the page now and not to the image.
  * Bug: Backlinks are now correctly rewritten when moving a page. The backlinks that were not in first position were be badly rewritten from ''%%[[id|description]]%%'' to ''%%[[newid]]|description]]%%''
