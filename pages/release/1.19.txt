====== ComboStrap - Release 1.19 ======


===== About =====

<note warning>
  * Php version 5.6 is no [[support:requirement|more supported]] because the SQlite Plugin does [[https://github.com/cosmocode/sqlite/blob/master/.github/workflows/phpTestLinux.yml#L13|not support it anymore]] (and the ''AbstractTest'' is failing on [[https://github.com/cosmocode/sqlite/blob/master/_test/AbstractTest.php#L14|line 14]] due to the '': void'')
  * If you had your private toolbar, you need to [[docs:layout:page:railbar#configuration|reconfigure it]] due to a change of name from ''toolbar'' to ''railbar''
</note>

This is a minor improvement release with bug fixes. The most improvement has been made on the [[docs:layout:page:railbar|toolbar]].

The toolbar:
  * has been renamed to ''railbar'' to not confound with the [[doku>toolbar|toolbar of the editor]]
  * is now grouped by type of tool
  * is also available in mobile screen.
  * is made available in an offcanvas from a configurable breakpoint


===== List =====

==== New ====
  * The [[docs:page:name|page name]] can now be used in a [[docs:templating:template|template]]
  * A [[docs:templating:pipeline|pipeline]] can use the ''capitalize'' function to capitalize the first letter of each word
  * New Configuration [[docs:router:router#enableUrlManager|enableUrlManager]] that permits to disable entirely the [[docs:router:router|URL manager]]. This can be useful in case of conflicting Routing plugin.
  * [[docs:analytics:statistics|page statistics]] got now [[docs:analytics:statistics#media|count statistics on media]].
  * [[docs:quality:broken_link|broken link]] takes now into account broken link to media (ie resource)

==== Change ====

  * The ''trail breadcrumb'' was renamed to [[docs:navigation:historical_breadcrumb|historical breadcrumb]] to reflect more the content (''Trail'' being a design term) and it has moved from the [[:strap|strap template]] to the [[docs:layout:page:railbar|railbar]] because it has a lower importance than the page content.

Before:

After:

{{:docs:navigation:historical_breadcrumb.png|}}

  * Due to the new [[docs:navigation:historical_breadcrumb|historical breadcrumb]], the [[docs:menubar:fixed-top|fixed-top menu margin]] was too small, we have added ''1 rem''.
  * The [[docs:navigation:page-explorer#list|page-explorer list]] panel does not underline any link to be conform with the style of the tree layout.
==== Improvement ====
  * The sidekick [[docs:layout:page:railbar|railbar]] icons have been grouped by type of tool (ie user, page, website)
  * The sidekick [[docs:layout:page:railbar|railbar]] is available on all screen size and goes now in an offcanvas from a configured breakpoint (default to md)
  * [[docs:templating:pipeline#cut|pipeline cut function]] allows a ''range'' selection. (ie all token after the first separator for instance)
  * [[docs:navigation:page-explorer|page-explorer]]: all templates got default value and have then been made optional.
  * In [[docs:navigation:page-explorer|page-explorer]], the ''home'' template follows the ''page'' template if not present. If the ''home'' tag is present but empty, the ''home'' section is not shown.
  * [[docs:navigation:page-explorer|page-explorer]] got the [[docs:styling:userstyle#class|custom generated class]] for custom styling
  * [[docs:navigation:page-explorer|page-explorer]]: the home page is now the first element in a tree. It was after the child namespaces making it difficult to spot.
==== Bug ====

  * semi-bug: Page request with the [[doku>config:send404]] config enabled would return a 404 even if a page with a [[docs:page:canonical|canonical]] was found. Because the http status is set at the beginning, we can't change it, we send therefore an error message
  * bug: the toolbar editor for a blockquote was closed not with a blockquote tag.
  * bug: the [[:security#content_security_policy|http header content security policy]] were send after output causing the below warning. They are now send when dokuwiki starts.
<file>
Warning: Cannot modify header information - headers already sent by (output started at C:\DokuWikiStick\dokuwiki\lib\tpl\strap\main.php:157)
in C:\DokuWikiStick\dokuwiki\lib\plugins\combo\action\metacsp.php on line 82
</file>
  * Minor bug: they the ''Jquery-ui'' closing icon was not showing up. As reported on this conversation, we have moved the ''Jquery-ui'' library to be called after the bootstrap library.
{{:release:bug_jquery_ui_closing_icon_missing.png|}}
  * Bug: [[docs:quality:protection|Page protection]] was returning an authorization code in place of a filtered list of result causing an error when searching.
  * Bug: [[docs:content:tooltip|tooltip]] was not working with [[docs:utility:jquery|Jquery alone]] because of a case error (ie ''jQuery.fn.tooltip.Constructor'' in place of ''jQuery.fn.tooltip.constructor'')
  * Bug: [[docs:navigation:page-explorer|page-explorer]] javascript would throw an error when the current page was not in the created tree because it would try to open the directory or set the link as active.
  * Bug: The [[docs:menubar:fixed-top|fixed-top menu]] height correction was not applied on the image detail page, leading to the heading and a part of the image to be cached under the page header. The [[docs:layout:page:railbar|railbar]] was also missing and has been added.
