====== ComboStrap - Release 1.19 ======


===== About =====
This is a minor improvement release with bug fixes. The most improvement has been made on the [[docs:layout:page:railbar|toolbar]]. 

The toolbar:
  * has been renamed to ''railbar'' to not confound with the [[doku>toolbar|toolbar of the editor]]
  * is now grouped by type of tool
  * is also available in mobile screen.
  * is made available in an offcanvas from a configurable breakpoint 

===== List =====
==== Improvement ====
  * The sidekick [[docs:layout:page:railbar|railbar]] icons have been grouped by type of tool (ie user, page, website)
  * The sidekick [[docs:layout:page:railbar|railbar]] is available on all screen size and goes now in an offcanvas from a configured breakpoint (default to md)
  * [[docs:utility:pipeline#cut|pipeline cut function]] allows a ''range'' selection. (ie all token after the first separator for instance)

==== Bug ====

  * semi-bug: Page request with the [[doku>config:send404]] config enabled would return a 404 even if a page with a [[docs:semantic:canonical|canonical]] was found. Because the http status is set at the beginning, we can't change it, we send therefore an error message
  * bug: the toolbar editor for a blockquote was closed not with a blockquote tag.
  * bug: the [[:security#content_security_policy|http header content security policy]] were send after output causing the below warning. They are now send when dokuwiki starts.
