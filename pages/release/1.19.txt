====== ComboStrap - Release 1.19 ======


===== About =====

===== List =====
==== Improvement ====
  * The sidekick [[docs:layout:page:toolbar|toolbar]] icons have been grouped by type of tool (ie user, page, website)

==== Bug ====

  * semi-bug: Page request with the [[doku>config:send404]] config enabled would return a 404 even if a page with a [[docs:semantic:canonical|canonical]] was found. Because the http status is set at the beginning, we can't change it, we send therefore an error message
  * bug: the toolbar editor for a blockquote was closed not with a blockquote tag.
