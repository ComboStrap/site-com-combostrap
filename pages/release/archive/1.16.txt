===== List =====

==== New ====
=== Identify forms ===
[[docs:app:identity|Identify forms]]
  * New: login form
  * New register form
  * New resend form 

=== Toggle ===

  * New: [[docs:animation:toggle|toggle]] allows [[docs:content:link|link]] as control element.
  * New: You can set the scroll mechanism to [[docs:styling:dimension##toggle_scroll|toggle]] on a [[docs:styling:dimension#height|constrained height box]]. It works also with any [[docs:utility:prism#constrained by height|prism component]] such as [[docs:block:code|code]], [[docs:block:file|file]], [[docs:block:console|console]]

=== Styling ===
  * ''Internal'' and ''Mail'' [[docs:content:link|link]] accepts now all [[docs:styling:styling|styling attribute]] (even [[docs:styling:text-color?color=#495057|text color]])
  * New: [[docs:styling:underline|underline]] accepts also ''false'' to not decorate a link for instance.

==== Improvement ====

  * Improvement: [[docs:semantic:frontmatter|frontmatter]] process now the metadata at the render phase.

==== Deleted ====
  * The option to span multiple line is no more supported for a [[docs:content:link|link]] to preserve the parse tree. See error below.

==== Bug Solved ====

  * Bug: A [[docs:content:link|link]] not closed (without '']]'') followed by a closed link was making the parse tree not even and caused parsing issue on [[docs:content:heading|heading]] and other traversal.
  * Bug: [[docs:layout:component:slide|slide]] had no padding on small screen
  * Bug: A Layout Shift was occuring because
    * their was no ''width'' and ''height'' attribute on a [[docs:content:svg|svg]] that added via the ''img'' 
    * the styling of the svg returned was set to ''height"100%'' in place of ''height:auto''

{{:release:layout_shift_bug.png|}}

  * Bug: SEO, the page queried by the [[docs:semantic:canonical|canonical]] were not added to the search index. Why ? Because they got a meta robots value of ''noindex,follow'' via the ''tpl_metaheaders'' function of Dokuwiki that check the ''$INFO['exists']'' value.

==== Renaming ====

  * rename: ''collapse'' has been renamed to [[docs:animation:toggle|toggle]]

==== Minor Modification ====

  * Minor Modification: Due to the [[docs:animation:toggle|toggle]], the [[docs:utility:prism|prism class styling]] have been renamed from ''code-combo-pre'' to ''code-container-combo''
