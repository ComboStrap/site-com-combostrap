====== ComboStrap - Release 1.13  ======


===== About =====
The [[..:release|release]] ''1.13'' was focus on the creation of ''landing page'' components. This is the first ''landing page'' release. The next will be ''landing page'' perfect with full animation and layout.


<note important>
Due to [[release:archive:1.13_bootstrap5|introduction of Bootstrap 5 in this release]], a configuration update is require. As the bootstrap version and the stylesheet are now in the same [[docs:utility:bootstrap#configuration|configuration]], you need after the update to set it back to your [[docs:styling:stylesheet|preferred stylesheet]] back.

==== Markup perfect ====
Markup perfect means that there is no need to tweak the output via styling.

  * Improvement: Placing a [[docs:content:button|button]] in a [[docs:menubar:menubar|navbar]] does not require any [[docs:styling:spacing|spacing]] attribute. The [[docs:content:button|button]] spacing is automatically created.

  * Update: The test are testing now that the HTML generation is ''XHMTL'' compliant. This is no more done with the hand.
  * New: ''Bootstrap perfect'': We generate exactly the same markup than [[docs:utility:bootstrap|bootstrap]]. [[docs:block:card|card]] and [[docs:block:blockquote|blockquote]] have now bootstrap paragraph with the ''text'' class making them easier to read.
  * New: Template Protection: We empty the php buffer before printing and send a message to admin user. Otherwise, plugins that print directly may mess the page completely.
  * Improvement: For boolean attributes such as ''selected'' for a [[docs:layout:component:tabs|panel tab]], this is no more needed to specify the value. ie ''selected'' is equivalent to ''selected=true''
  * Improvement: A [[docs:block:note|note]] is now markup perfect (a stack) and accepts paragraph inside
  * New: [[docs:styling:float|floating right]] will add a margin at the left.


==== Bug ====

  * Bug: A [[docs:content:link#image|image link]] points to the page now and not to the image.
  * Bug: Backlinks are now correctly rewritten when moving a page. The backlinks that were not in first position were be badly rewritten from ''%%[[id|description]]%%'' to ''%%[[newid]]|description]]%%''
