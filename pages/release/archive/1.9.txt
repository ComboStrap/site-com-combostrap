====== ComboStrap - Release 1.9 =======

===== About =====
The version 1.9 was a bug fix release. (2020-10-31)

===== List of changes =====

  * Bug: A Dokuwiki table inside a [[deprecated:tabs#tabpanel|tabpanel]] was giving wrongfully a warning.
  * Bug: The ''data-name'' attribute is used by illustrator to set layer information and was causing a problem in the [[ui:icon|icon]] component.
  * Bug: The failed state HTML element of the file uploader (ie the form in the media manager) was visible by default. A css rule was added to default it to none. [[https://github.com/ComboStrap/dokuwiki-template-strap/commit/128140f1aeaba52dfa5afe80059c2dd623a9b0c1|commit]]
  * Bug: [[ui:ntoc|Ntoc]], [[ui:related|Related]], [[ui:cite|cite]] - PHP Fatal error:  Allowed memory size of 134217728 bytes exhausted (tried to allocate 98570240 bytes) in inc/Cache/CacheInstructions.php on line 44 -
      * The Dokuwiki function ''p_get_metadata'' can render and create a recursive call, we get the title now without rendering.
      * The ''handler call tree'' was returned as return argument of the ''handle'' function, we don't pass it anymore
  * Improvement: Expected ''Php warning'' does not appear anymore in the log (for instance when trying the decode a string as XML to see if it's an XML)
