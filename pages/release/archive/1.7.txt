====== ComboStrap - Release 1.7 ======

===== About =====
[[..:release|release]] 1.7 from 2020-07-31

===== Change list =====

  * A [[release:deprecated:title|dokuwiki heading title]] can now be used in a [[release:deprecated:tabs#tabpanels|tabpanel]]
  * The [[docs:navigation:page-explorer|namespace toc]] accepts now the definition of an ''index'' and ''ns-item'' to define a line for the index page and the sub-namespace
  * Every link in a component does not get the dokuwiki class (''wikilink1'') to get a consistent styling with [[docs:utility:bootstrap|bootstrap]].
  * Links inside [[docs:content:button|button]] inherit the color of its parent as bootstrap does not style a link inside a button
  * Added [[docs:cache:sideslots|automatic cache bursting]] to delete the cache of the sidebar when an element has changed in a namespace in order to get a consistent output.
