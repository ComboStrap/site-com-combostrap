===== Change List =====

==== Miscellaneous ====
  * Improvement: The [[ui:note|note component]] got also the [[styling:userstyle#class|userstyle class]].

  * New [[ui:typo|typographic page]]
  * Change: The ''typo'' component has been renamed to [[ui:text|text]]
  * New: the [[ui:text|text component]] accepts to style several paragraph at once
  * New: the [[ui:itext|itext component]] accepts to style several words at once (i for [[ui:inline|inline]])
  * New: the [[ui:text|text component]] accepts to a [[ui:text#line-spacing|line-spacing attribute]] to set the height between each line of a paragraph
  * New: the [[styling:text-align|text-align]] attribute can now be conditional and takes the start and end notation
  * New: the [[styling:opacity|opacity attribute]] has its own page and can be applied to all component (not only to [[styling:background|background]])
  * New: the [[styling:boldness|boldness attribute]] to set the font-weight from extra-light to extra-dark.

==== Bug Solved ====

  * [[ui:box|box]] does not delete paragraphs anymore (ie has become a stack component)

==== Markup perfect ====
  * A [[ui:note|note]] does not have any extra bottom margin. Due to the last paragraph of a [[ui:note|note]] and the default stylesheet of the browser, the content was not centered vertically.

==== Deprecated ====
  * [[release:deprecated:dynamic_grid|grid of 16 (dynamic grid)]] is deprecated from Bootstrap 5
