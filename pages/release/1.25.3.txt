====== Combo Release 1.25.3 ======






===== Bug =====
  * infinite loop on unknown URL parameters creating a memory error - [[https://github.com/ComboStrap/combo/issues/79|User manager breaks when combo enabled]] - The logging system was logging unknown parameters creating a loop if combo was creating the context.
  * heading numbering at 0. Combostrap supports the flat HTML of Dokuwiki and the modern HTML section for heading. The heading counters were not reset in the good node as requested by css. [[https://github.com/ComboStrap/combo/commit/484d95f4810f08e1869bd5ad543525a3df42d868|commit]]

===== Improvement =====
  * We have added the [[:docs:templating:sql#date predicate|date section in the Page Sql]] to show how to make a filtering.
  * Prompt and line-numbers were overwriting each other on [[:docs:utility:prism|prism component]]. Prompt is not shown if line numbers options has been set. [[https://github.com/ComboStrap/combo/issues/82|Bug]]
  * [[https://github.com/ComboStrap/combo/issues/84|External Metadata manipulation]] may lead to null value

===== New Feature =====
  * The ''now'' keyword can now be used in the [[:docs:templating:sql|Page Sql]] [[https://github.com/ComboStrap/combo/commit/5b7a56ccb7c57144ce99d82ebd684c7eb5d4f441|commit]]

  * [[:docs:utility:prism#line highlight|Line highlighting]] has been added to [[:docs:utility:prism|Prism component (code, file, ...)]] ([[https://github.com/ComboStrap/combo/issues/83|Feature request]])

Example [[:docs:utility:prism#line highlight|Line highlighting]]:

<code html line-numbers="true" line-highlight="1-3, 5">
    <p>Line 1</p>
    <p>Line 2</p>
    <p>Line 3</p>
    <p>Line 4</p>
    <p>Line 5</p>
</code>


===== New documentation =====

  * A howto has been created to show how you can use the start date and end date: [[:howto:iterator-list-event|]]
