====== Release 1.25.2 ======





===== Modification =====
  * A private [[:docs:theme:element:railbar|railbar]] disallow the media manager and the diff action to avoid the SEO indexing warning: ''Excluded By No Index Tag''.

{{:docs:theme:element:excluded_by_noindex_tag_google_console.jpg?400|}}

  * Permanent Redirect from the [[:docs:router:router|router]] does not get any query string anymore  to avoid the SEO indexing warning: ''Alternative page with proper canonical tag''

  * The [[:docs:analytics:syntax_count|syntax analytics]] does not show the component anymore but the tag. Why? To improve performance, we capture all [[:docs:marki|combo markup]] with one syntax, the tag was not part anymore of the component and was always ''combo_xmltag''. We show know the tag for better analytics.
===== Bug =====

==== TaskRunner eating all  memory ====

The  ''Taskrunner'' process may run multiple times concurrently eating all memory. Only the indexer has now a lock
See [[https://forum.dokuwiki.org/d/21044-taskrunner-running-multiple-times-eating-the-memory-lock/2|taskrunner-running-multiple-times-eating-the-memory-lock]]. We have therefore added a lock to run our event system sequentially.
