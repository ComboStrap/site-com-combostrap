====== Release 1.25.2 ======



===== About =====
This page is about the details of the release 1.25.2

===== Breaking modification =====

The [[:docs:analytics:syntax_count|syntax analytics]] does not show the component anymore but the tag. Why? To improve performance, we capture all [[:docs:marki|combo markup]] with one syntax, the tag was not part anymore of the component and was always ''combo_xmltag''. We show know the tag for better analytics.

===== Improvements =====

==== Last Sqlite Plugin Support ====

The [[https://www.dokuwiki.org/plugin:sqlite#changes_from_earlier_releases|last Sqlite plugin release]] has brought breaking changes.
We support it now. See [[https://github.com/ComboStrap/combo/commit/d899a2a62926ce6e7f78d85d882eb464caef0a95|Commit]]

==== Mermaid upgrade ====

The [[:docs:utility:mermaid|mermaid diagram]] are now on the last version 10.2.3 that have a nicer look.

==== Private Toolbar disallow media manager and diff action ====

A private [[:docs:theme:element:railbar|railbar]] disallow the media manager and the diff action to avoid the SEO indexing warning: ''Excluded By No Index Tag''.

{{:docs:theme:element:excluded_by_noindex_tag_google_console.jpg?400|}}

==== No query string for permanent redirection ====

Permanent Redirect from the [[:docs:router:router|router]] does not get any query string anymore  to avoid the SEO indexing warning: ''Alternative page with proper canonical tag''



==== No default for the webcode toolbar button ====

The [[:docs:utility:webcode|webcode toolbar]] does not have any default anymore.


==== TaskRunner lock ====

The  ''Taskrunner'' process may run multiple times concurrently eating all memory. Only the indexer has now a lock
See [[https://forum.dokuwiki.org/d/21044-taskrunner-running-multiple-times-eating-the-memory-lock/2|taskrunner-running-multiple-times-eating-the-memory-lock]]. We have therefore added a lock to run our event system sequentially.

<console>
 Pid Cpu Mem
2198 75 1 Running /lib/exe/taskrunner.php?id=infra%3Aansible%3Astatus&1682671302
1179 44 8 Running /lib/exe/taskrunner.php?id=dat%3Aobiee%3Aobis%3Acast_as_date&1682686473
2166 44 8 Running /lib/exe/taskrunner.php?id=data_mining%3Af_statistic&1682713733
2181 25 8 Running /lib/exe/taskrunner.php?id=data%3Atype%3Acube%3Amodeling%3Amodeling&1682705762
</console>


It was not sufficient, we added a lock on the whole ''taskrunner'' process because it was eating all the memory. 

==== Locks were not deleted in case of timeout ====

Because long processes may not terminate in the time given, timeout exception may occur.
In this case, the ''taskrunner'' lock was not deleted. We have added a [[https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.register-shutdown-function.php|shutdown php hook]] to delete them.

If you have a lot of timeouts, you may need to modify:
  * the php.ini
  * or the file ''lib/exe/taskrunner.php'' to increase it.

Example:
<code php lib/exe/taskrunner.php>
// instead of 30 seconds
set_time_limit(60);
</code>



===== Bug =====


==== Boolean Values were not written ====

See [[https://github.com/ComboStrap/combo/issues/61|Issue 61]]

==== Replication date was always empty on the metadata manager ====


The replication date is the only metadata written to the database and not on the disk. This difference was not taken into account when sending data to the [[:docs:metadata:manager|metadata manager]].

==== Error when the Url was not correct ====

The log file was filed with the following URL:
<console>
ComboStrap\ExceptionRuntimeInternal: The url in src has a bad encoding (the attribute have a amp; prefix. Infinite cache will not work.
/opt/dokuwiki/lib/plugins/combo/ComboStrap/Web/Url.php(210)
</console>

Why? ComboStrap was throwing an error for bad URLs.

Solution: We don't throw a failure anymore but a warning. This error does not come from Combostrap but from external requests. Mostly from Bots, scanning your website.
