====== ComboStrap - Release 1.24 ======



===== List =====
==== New ====
  * New documentation for the [[docs:layout:page:main|main slot]] (content)
  * Two new slots:
      * the [[docs:layout:page:main_header|main header slot]] at the top of the main slot
      * the [[docs:layout:page:main_footer|main footer slot]] at the bottom of the main slot
  * The [[docs:navigation:hierarchical_breadcrumb|hiearchical breadcrumb]] has now its own syntax component.
  * Added a lot of [[docs:content:icon#library|Icon Libraries]] from elegant theme, IconScout, Iconoir, Core Ui Brand, ... to eva icons 
  * You can now add more than [[docs:social:share|Share Buttons]] for instance in the [[docs:layout:page:footer_slot|footer slot]]
  * We have added a [[support:preserve|preserve]] attribute to overwrite the [[docs:performance:svg_optimization|default svg optimization]] on style. More ... see [[support:preserve]]

==== Improvement ====
  * The linkwizard used in the [[docs:menubar:search|search box]] performs a search on each term and is now case insensitive.
  * [[docs:performance:svg_optimization|Svg/Icon optimization]]: when a path has a fill attribute of none on icon we delete it (See new support article: [[support:preserve]])
  * For a solid [[docs:content:icon|icon]], if the color is set, we delete all ''fill'' attribute in path element.
  * For a outline [[docs:content:icon|icon]], if the color is set, we delete all ''stroke'' attribute in path element
  * Internal: Added the notion of ''markup ref'' in the [[docs:content:link|link]] in order to be able to call the link component to add link that comes not from the content, (ie [[docs:social:share|share link]])
  * The [[docs:menubar:brand|brand component]] has been improved and supports all brand icon included the brand of the actual app. It can be seen as a super interwiki that follows the branding.
  * The [[docs:app:manifest|manifest]] got:
      * an automatic test 
      * the [[docs:app:color|primary branding color]]
      * an [[https://developer.chrome.com/blog/pwa-manifest-id/|id]] (now required)
      * ''any'' sizes on svg to bug fix the value set by dokuwiki (17x17, 512x512)
==== Bug ====

  * The snippets could be missing randomly. The snippets are now saved at the same time than the slot html output, making it less likely to miss if the rendering is stop inadvertently.
