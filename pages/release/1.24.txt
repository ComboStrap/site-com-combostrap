====== ComboStrap - Release 1.24 ======


===== About =====



===== Actions =====

  * The old [[release:deprecated:hierarchical_breadcrumb|renderer hierachical breadcrumb]] has been deleted. You should add the new [[docs:navigation:hierarchical_breadcrumb|hierarchical breadcrumb component]] in the new [[:slot_main_header|slot main header]]
===== List =====
==== New ====
  * New documentation for the [[docs:layout:page:main|main slot]] (content)
  * Two new slots:
      * the [[docs:layout:page:main_header_slot|main header slot]] at the top of the main slot
      * the [[docs:layout:page:main_footer_slot|main footer slot]] at the bottom of the main slot
  * The [[docs:navigation:hierarchical_breadcrumb|hiearchical breadcrumb]] has now its own syntax component.
  * The [[release:deprecated:hierarchical_breadcrumb|hierachical breadcrumb in the renderer]] is deprecated.
  * Added a lot of [[docs:content:icon#library|Icon Libraries]] from elegant theme, IconScout, Iconoir, Core Ui Brand, ... to eva icons 
  * You can now add more than [[docs:social:share|Share Buttons]] for instance in the [[docs:layout:page:footer_slot|footer slot]]
  * We have added a [[support:preserve|preserve]] attribute to overwrite the [[docs:performance:svg_optimization|default svg optimization]] on style. More ... see [[support:preserve]]
  * You can now set your [[docs:app:color|branding colors (primary and secondary)]] that brings a more cohesive styling on all solid component (filled)
  * The [[docs:content:icon|icon]] is now [[docs:app:color|branding color aware]]. It will take by default the color:
      * the [[docs:app:color|primary color]] if the width is bigger than 36 pixel
      * the [[docs:app:color|secondary color]] otherwise.
  * do page style. The admin and media manager got their style from the snippet manager. (Tabs were styled, bullet were deleted, icon got the primary value)
  * The [[docs:app:color|branding color]] are now inherited by default.
  * Added the edit button for the slots and styled them.
  * New: the [[docs:cache:viewer|Cache viewer]] permits to see cache information of the slots.
  * New: [[docs:content:lightbox|lightbox]]. When clicking on a image by default, a lightbox is showing up.


==== Change ====
  * The default color of [[docs:content:icon|icon]], [[docs:content:button|button]] is the [[docs:app:color|primary branding color]]
  * The primary and secondary color of bootstrap are overwritten by the [[docs:app:color|branding colors]] if set up.
  * The default ratio for a [[docs:block:card|card image]] is now ''16:9''.
==== Improvement ====
  * The linkwizard used in the [[docs:menubar:search|search box]] performs a search on each term and is now case insensitive.
  * [[docs:performance:svg_optimization|Svg/Icon optimization]]: when a path has a fill attribute of none on icon we delete it (See new support article: [[support:preserve]])
  * For a solid [[docs:content:icon|icon]], if the color is set, we delete all ''fill'' attribute in path element.
  * For a outline [[docs:content:icon|icon]], if the color is set, we delete all ''stroke'' attribute in path element
  * Internal: Added the notion of ''markup ref'' in the [[docs:content:link|link]] in order to be able to call the link component to add link that comes not from the content, (ie [[docs:social:share|share link]])
  * The [[docs:menubar:brand|brand component]] has been improved and supports all brand icon included the brand of the actual app. It can be seen as a super interwiki that follows the branding.
  * The [[docs:app:manifest|manifest]] got:
      * an automatic test 
      * the [[docs:app:color|primary branding color]]
      * an [[https://developer.chrome.com/blog/pwa-manifest-id/|id]] (now required)
      * ''any'' sizes on svg to bug fix the value set by dokuwiki (17x17, 512x512)
  * The svg illustration were shrinking on a table with the css property ''width: auto !important;'': we have added the width attribute in this case.
  * The ''illustrative image'' in a [[docs:block:card|card]] will stretch to take the whole horizontal space  (if too small, we get a blur effect but not white space).
  * [[docs:cache:page_expiration_frequency|Cache expiration]] does not purge the cache of the actual requested page. It creates a request for a new rendering that is done in the background improving the [[docs:performance:performance|performance]].
==== Bug ====

  * The snippets could be missing randomly. The snippets are now saved at the same time than the slot html output, making it less likely to miss if the rendering is stopped inadvertently.
  * When the [[docs:page:url|page url]] was permanent, the page info were not refreshed. The ''rev'' was not up to date and the edit button would not see that the page may have changed via the metadata manager (frontmatter)
  * Admin / Media manager page:
      * they were not working correctly and were sending back ''junk''. This was caused because the output is mainly generated by ''echo'' statement and the buffer was quickly full. We start the action that are not show now in the middle of the page.
      * they could use markup syntax and the css/javascript snippet were therefore not present. The snippet are now flushed in the content if this is not a page rendering.
  * The [[docs:admin:replication|page replication in the database]] was broken because the test was not checking the database replication date against the page date.
