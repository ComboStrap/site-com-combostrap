====== ComboStrap - Release 1.23 ======




===== List =====
==== New ====
  * The [[docs:content:svg|Svg]] and [[docs:content:icon|Icon]] are now taken into account as first image and becomes therefore available as [[docs:page:image|illustrative page image]]
  * The ratio and therefore the crop of a [[docs:page:image|illustrative page image]] is now supported for [[docs:content:svg|Svg]] and [[docs:content:icon|Icon]].
  * The [[docs:page:image#ratio|ratio]] is now first class citizen and can be used on all image, all syntax.
  * If a [[docs:page:image|illustrative page image]] is an icon (less than 30px), there is zoom of 3 that's applied to get a more pleasant visual.
  * The [[docs:social:telegram|telegram]] documentation on social graph
  * Added [[https://twemoji.twitter.com/|twitter emoji]] as [[docs:content:icon|icon library]]
  * Added [[https://ant.design/components/icon/|ant design]] as [[docs:content:icon|icon library]]
  * Added [[https://github.com/fefanto/fontaudio/|fad]] icon as [[docs:content:icon|icon library]]
  * Added [[https://clarity.design/foundation/icons/|Clairty icon]] as [[docs:content:icon|icon library]]
  * Added the [[https://primer.style/octicons/|github octicons]] as [[docs:content:icon|icon library]]



==== Improvement ====

  * The [[docs:admin:cli|cli]] documentation has been improved with Linux example and add the animal information in the output.
  * The ''carbon'' [[docs:content:icon|icon library]] is case sensitive. We follow the iconify standard and have added a mapping between lowercase name and physical name. For instance, [[https://icon-sets.iconify.design/carbon/csv/|csv]] is known in carbon as ''CSV''.
  * If an [[docs:content:icon|icon]] does not have a ''viewBox'', we create it to make it scalable. For instance, the [[https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fefanto/fontaudio/master/svgs/fad-random-1dice.svg|fad random dice]] is not scalable.

==== Bug ====

  * Svg loading error such as web server error 500 for [[docs:content:icon|icon]] sends now an error and does not crash the page
  * Icon without viewBox where not rendering correctly. In a [[docs:content:svg|svg]], if the viewBox is not present, we check now also the width and height of svg to determine the dimension.
