===== List =====

==== Improvement ====
  * A [[docs:templating:template|template]] sends an error when the page attribute was not found.
  * In a [[docs:templating:sql|sql]], the column attributes have been made optional.
  * If the [[docs:templating:sql|page sql]] has an error, a error message is returned (ie the page does not crash)
