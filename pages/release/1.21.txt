====== ComboStrap - Release 1.21 ======


===== List =====


==== New ====
  * The [[docs:semantic:event|event page]] to create event.
  * New [[docs:semantic:date|date]] page to describe the date format.
  * We support now [[docs:content:image#cropping|cropped image]] on all [[docs:content:raster|raster image feature]] such as [[docs:performance:lazy|lazy loading]], responsiveness and more

==== Improvement ====
  * A [[docs:templating:template|template]] sends an error when the [[docs:templating:variable|page attribute]] was not found.
  * In a [[docs:templating:sql|sql]], the column attributes have been made optional.
  * If the [[docs:templating:sql|page sql]] has an error, a error message is returned (ie the page does not crash)
  * Not all [[docs:templating:variable|page attribute]] can be used to filter the pages, an error message is returned if this is the case
  * The [[docs:templating:sql#filter-attribute|sql filter attribute]] have been expanded with 7 new attributes
  * More [[docs:semantic:date|date format]] are now supported
