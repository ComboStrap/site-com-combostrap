====== ComboStrap - Release 1.21 ======


===== List =====


==== New ====
  * The [[docs:semantic:event|event page]] to create event.
  * New [[docs:semantic:date|date]] page to describe the date format.
  * We support now [[docs:content:image#cropping|cropped image]] on all [[docs:content:raster|raster image feature]] such as [[docs:performance:lazy|lazy loading]], responsiveness and more
  * All [[docs:content:image|image]] have now a [[docs:cache:cache|cache]] buster that will make the HTML img URL not valid if the image has been changed
  * The [[docs:diagram:mermaid|mermaid]] component to render diagram with the ''mermaid'' library (from sequence to gant, to state and other UML diagram)

==== Improvement ====
  * A [[docs:templating:template|template]] sends an error when the [[docs:templating:variable|page attribute]] was not found.
  * In a [[docs:templating:sql|sql]], the column attributes have been made optional.
  * If the [[docs:templating:sql|page sql]] has an error, a error message is returned (ie the page does not crash)
  * Not all [[docs:templating:variable|page attribute]] can be used to filter the pages, an error message is returned if this is the case
  * The [[docs:templating:sql#filter-attribute|sql filter attribute]] have been expanded with 7 new attributes
  * More [[docs:semantic:date|date format]] are now supported
  * A HTML [[docs:cache:page|page cache file]] may have an empty content due to timeout (or any other problem), we delete the cache in this case.

==== Modified ====

  * The [[docs:semantic:frontmatter#configuration|auto-frontmatter]] configuration has been disabled. Users could just not see it and leave with the default value without changing them.
==== Migration ====
  * The [[docs:utility:prism|prism]] component uses now the last version 1.25 with added language support for highligting.

==== Bug ====
  * The [[docs:diagram:railroad|railroad]] could overflow. There is now a lift if this is the case.
  * The [[docs:diagram:railroad|railroad]] SRI browser control is not the same, we have added also the version number in the path.
  * A space would be missing after an acronym link in a note. ie the space before the ''and'' in ''%%[[path|ACCR]] and%%'' would have been deleted.
