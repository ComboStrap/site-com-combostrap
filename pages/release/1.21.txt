====== ComboStrap - Release 1.21 ======


===== About =====
This release brought an improve templating system:
  * this is possible to print the [[docs:semantic:image|image of a page]] with the [[docs:content:page-image|page-image]]
  * the columns have been made optional in the [[docs:templating:sql|sql]]
  * the [[docs:content:date|date component]] permits to print a date in a supported format.

A lot of [[#new diagrams|diagrams]] have also been added and a big [[#performance|performance boost]] on static resources.

<note warning>
=== Breaking ===
With the advent of the [[docs:templating:iterator|iterator]], we have standardized the analytics name. If you have queries running on the [[docs:analytics:statistics|statistics data]], you should change them. All count name are now singular. For instance: ''internal_backlinks_count'' is now ''internal_backlink_count'', ''emails_count'' is now ''emails_count'', ...
</note>
===== List =====


==== New ====
  * The [[docs:semantic:event|event page]] to create event.
  * New : the [[docs:semantic:date|date]] page that describes the date format supported in metadata.
  * ''backlinks'': 
      * Added the [[docs:navigation:backlink|backlink page]] to give more information
      * The pages table get also the ''backlink_count'' column

=== New Diagrams ===

      * [[:docs:diagram:erd]]
      * [[docs:diagram:gantt]]
      * [[docs:diagram:flowchart]]
      * [[docs:diagram:piechart]]
      * [[docs:diagram:sequence]]
      * [[:docs:diagram:state]]
      * [[:docs:diagram:user-journey]]
  * Based on the [[docs:utility:mermaid|mermaid]] component (to render diagram with the ''mermaid'' library)

=== Performance  ===

  * [[docs:cache:static|Infinite Static Cache]]: cache for an infinite amount of time all public static resources - making the rendering  much much sneller.
  * All [[docs:content:image|image]] have now a [[docs:cache:cache|cache]] buster that will make the HTML img URL not valid if the image has been changed, part of [[docs:cache:static|infinite static cache]]
  * We support now [[docs:content:image#cropping|cropped image]] on all [[docs:content:raster|raster image feature]] such as [[docs:performance:lazy|lazy loading]], responsiveness and more. This was needed for the new [[docs:content:page-image|pageimage component]].

==== Improvement ====
  * A [[docs:templating:template|template]] sends an error when the [[docs:templating:variable|page attribute]] was not found.
  * In a [[docs:templating:sql|sql]], the column attributes have been made optional.
  * If the [[docs:templating:sql|page sql]] has an error, a error message is returned (ie the page does not crash)
  * Not all [[docs:templating:variable|page attribute]] can be used to filter the pages, an error message is returned if this is the case
  * The [[docs:templating:sql#filter-attribute|sql filter attribute]] have been expanded with 7 new attributes
  * More [[docs:semantic:date|date format]] are now supported
  * A HTML [[docs:cache:page|page cache file]] may have an empty content due to timeout (or any other problem), we delete the cache in this case.
  * [[docs:navigation:related|Related]] follows now the useheading configuration of dokuwiki
  * New [[docs:quality:xhtml|XHTML page]] that shows the quality of the HTML page generated

==== Modified ====

  * The [[docs:semantic:frontmatter#configuration|auto-frontmatter]] configuration has been disabled. Users could just not see it and leave with the default value without changing them.
  * The default description for [[docs:content:link#internal|internal link]] is now the [[docs:semantic:name|page name]]. It was the last part of the [[docs:semantic:path|path]].
  * The [[docs:navigation:hierarchical_breadcrumb|hierachical breadcrumb]] gots also the [[docs:semantic:name|page name]] in the link description. 
==== Migration ====
  * The [[docs:utility:prism|prism]] component uses now the last version 1.25 with added language support for highligting (ie [[docs:utility:mermaid|mermaid]])

==== Bug ====
  * The [[docs:diagram:railroad|railroad]] could overflow. There is now a lift if this is the case.
  * The [[docs:diagram:railroad|railroad]] SRI browser control is not the same, we have added also the version number in the path.
  * A space would be missing after an acronym link in a note. ie the space before the ''and'' in ''%%[[path|ACCR]] and%%'' would have been deleted.
  * The [[docs:content:link#email|email link]] if containing a subject would not be in a good HTML format.
