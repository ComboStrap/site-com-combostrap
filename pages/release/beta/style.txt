====== Release Beta - Style Component ======



===== About =====


The ''style'' component is an component that contains CSS declarations that will be applied to its parent component. 

This is an utility component that:
  * makes it easier to apply a serie of CSS declarations.
  * supports the element state (ie ''active'',''focus'',''hover'',...)
  * is XHTML compliant. The declarations are brought into the HTML ''head'' if needed.

        color:white;
        background-color:purple;
    </style>
A card with another style when you hover over it.

<note tip>
This is an example of [[docs:animation:hover#custom|custom hover animation]] but you can use the [[docs:animation:hover|built-in ones]] to animate your component and brings more emphasis.
