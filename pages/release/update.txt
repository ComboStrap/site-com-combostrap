====== Update ======


===== About =====
This page lists the standard steps that need to be taken in order to update your ComboStrap installation


For each new release, we recommend the following steps:
  * [[docs:getting_started:3_strap|update strap]] (This step should be executed first if you use php-fpm because the classes stay in memory and combo uses them)
  * [[docs:getting_started:2_combo|update combo]]
  * refresh the index with the [[support:plugin#search_index_manager|Search Index Manager]].
