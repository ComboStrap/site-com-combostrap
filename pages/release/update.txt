====== How to update Combo or a third party-plugin? ======


===== About =====
This page lists the standard steps that need to be taken in order to update your ComboStrap installation and third-party plugins.



===== Combo Upgrade Steps =====
For each new release, there are two steps to perform:
  * Updating the combo plugin
  * Refreshing the index

==== How to update the combo plugin? ====

Because of the [[support:oom|memory error]], the Combo plugin needs to be updated manually via the ''manual install'' tab.

  * In the [[doku>plugin:extension|extension manager]], click on the ''manual install'' tab
  * Enter the Github Url: ''https://github.com/ComboStrap/combo/archive/main.zip''
  * Check the box ''Overwrite existing files''
  * And click the ''install'' button.

==== How to refresh the index? ====

To refresh the index, you can do it:
  * from a web page, with the [[support:plugin#search_index_manager|Search Index Manager]].
  * from the terminal on the server (quicker) [[:docs:analytics:replication#cli|with the combo cli]] ''metadata-to-database'' command.


===== How to update a third plugin such as SQLite? =====

Unfortunately, the update process is not scoped to the plugin updated but to all plugins. It means that you will get a [[support:oom|memory error]] when you try to update a plugin if ''combo'' is installed and enabled.

To update a third plugin, you have two solutions. You can:
  * disable ''combo'' before updating a third-party plugin.
  * install it manually with the same steps as the combo plugin.


For instance, for SQLite, the manual install steps would be:
  * Get the download URL by clicking on the arrow

  * Go to the ''Manual Install'' tab
  * Copy the URL into the ''Install from URL'' field
  * Select the checkbox ''overwrite existing files''
  * And click the ''Install'' button
