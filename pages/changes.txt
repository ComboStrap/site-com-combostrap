  * [[quality:automatic_hidden|New automatic hidden page]]: the internal page such as the bars and namespace are now automatically hidden. No configuration is needed.
  * New: a new [[ui:box|Box]] component was introduced to group other component and allows for instance to define a [[ui:collapse|collapse]] target.
  * New: the [[ui:preformatted|preformatted mode]] of dokuwiki is disabled by default in order to be able to write hierarchical block.

==== Version 1.10 - 2021-01-09 ====


List:
  * Added [[https://bootswatch.com/|Bootswatch theme]] in the [[styling:stylesheet|stylesheet]]
  * A ''link'' has now a transparent background by default to avoid getting a rectangle in the [[ui:button|button]] with the ''bootswatch'' theme.
  * ''Section Highlighting'' of Dokuwiki has been replaced because it was moving the edit button around. We put now just a light background on hover.
  * Bug: No ''rewrite of the links'' when the page is moved. Combo takes over the links in the bootstrap component such as [[ui:button|button]], [[ui:cite|cite]] in order to set the Bootstrap style. Because the move plugin takes into account the standard dokuwiki link detection, they were not rewritten.

==== Version 1.9 - 2020-10-31 ====
The version 1.9 was a bug fix release.
  * Bug: A Dokuwiki table inside a [[ui:tabs#tabpanel|tabpanel]] was giving wrongfully a warning.
  * Bug: The ''data-name'' attribute is used by illustrator to set layer information and was causing a problem in the [[ui:icon|icon]] component.
  * Bug: The failed state HTML element of the file uploader (ie the form in the media manager) was visible by default. A css rule was added to default it to none. [[https://github.com/ComboStrap/dokuwiki-template-strap/commit/128140f1aeaba52dfa5afe80059c2dd623a9b0c1|commit]]
  * Bug: [[ui:ntoc|Ntoc]], [[ui:related|Related]], [[ui:cite|cite]] - PHP Fatal error:  Allowed memory size of 134217728 bytes exhausted (tried to allocate 98570240 bytes) in inc/Cache/CacheInstructions.php on line 44 - 
      * The Dokuwiki function ''p_get_metadata'' can render and create a recursive call, we get the title now without rendering.
      * The ''handler call tree'' was returned as return argument of the ''handle'' function, we don't pass it anymore
  * Improvement: Expected ''Php warning'' does not appear anymore in the log (for instance when trying the decode a string as XML to see if it's an XML) 
==== Version 1.8 - 2020-09-03 ====
The version 1.8 was a bug fix release.
  * Bug: [[strap:sidekickbor|sidekickbar]] configuration was missspeld to ''sideckickbar'' in place of ''sidekickbar''
  * Bug: Check if the php sqlite extension is installed. When it was not installed, the SQLite Plugin returns a null value.
  * Bug: [[ui:ntoc|Navigational Toc]] was not rendering correctly sub-namespace due to a bad predicate, index page was not filtered due to a semi-colon, the directory were rendering as a page if there was no template and as it was cached, the result was not accurate if the namespace was showing a parent sidebar
