The ''URL manager'' (known formerly as the ''404manager'') manages the behavior of [[doku>|Dokuwiki]] when an [[kb>url|URL]] does not match a [[doku>pagename|Dokuwiki page]].

In case of [[url:404|missing page]], the ''URL Manager'' can [[redirection|redirect]]:
    * a writer to the edit mode
    * a reader (ie public or search engine) to the best page following an [[redirection|algorithm]].
    * shows [[message|a message (with optionally a list of the pages with the same name)]]
