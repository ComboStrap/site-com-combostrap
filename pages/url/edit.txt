====== ComboStrap URL Management - Edit Mode Redirection ======


===== About =====


By default, when a page does not exist, ''Dokuwiki'' will show you an empty page. 

With the ''edit mode'' [[redirection|redirection]], a writer (ie a user with the edit permission) can be redirected directly to the ''edit form''.

<note tip>
A [[message|message]] can also be shown with the pages that have the same name.
