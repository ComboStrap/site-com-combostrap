====== ComboStrap Ads - Automatic In-Article Ads ======


===== About =====
''In-article Ads'' are ads that will show up in the page content.


<note>
This is an automatic placement which means that they follows a set of rule that:
  * spread the ''ads'' roughly to have one ''ad'' on the screen.
  * does not break the reading experience by placing them before a heading and not between paragraph.
This placement conforms to most of the Ads network rules.

===== How to enable automatic in-article ads ? =====

==== Enable the Renderer ====


The [[ui:renderer|Combo Renderer]] is responsible to inject the ad in the page. 

You need to [[:configuration|configure]] it as your renderer.

{{:ui:combo_renderer_setting.png?500|}}


==== Exclude the ads page from the index ====

Because the ''ads'' are stored as page, they are by default added to the index.

You need to set a configuration to prevent it. 

See [[conf]]

==== Create your ads ====
At this point, no ads is shown because no ''ads'' have been created.

To show ''in-article ads'', you need to create [[page|Ads pages]] that follow this naming convention.
<code>
inarticleX
</code>
where X is the Ads number in the page and starts at 1.

For instance:
  * the [[page|ad page]] ''inarticle1'' will contain the first ''in-article ad''.
  * the [[page|ad page]] ''inarticle2'' will contain the second ''in-article ad''.

===== Configuration =====



==== AdsInArticleShowPlaceholder ====
''AdsInArticleShowPlaceholder '' is a [[:configuration|configuration]] that will show a placeholder when a ''in-article'' [[page|ads page]] is not found.

This is a debugging configuration and is therefore by default ''off''.
