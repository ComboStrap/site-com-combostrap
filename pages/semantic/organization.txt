====== ComboStrap Metadata - Organization Page ======

===== About =====
An ''organization'' page is a [[type|type of page]] that defines information about your organization.


<note>
[[google|Google]] uses it to create the [[https://developers.google.com/search/docs/data-types/logo|knowledge panel]]
</note>
===== How to create an organization page =====
To create a page on your website that contains your organization  information such as our [[:about_us|About us]] page, you need to define the [[type|type]] to ''Organization''

<code json>
{
   "type":"organization"
}
</code>

Combostrap will then add the following properties:
  * ''url'': the base url
  * ''logo'': the [[logo|logo]]
  * ''name'': the [[doku>config:title|site title]]
  * ''slogan'': the [[tagline|tagline]]
  * the [[twitter|twitter]] url if the handle is known
  * the [[facebook|facebook]] url if the handle is known

===== How to add extra properties =====

We also supports the creation of an ''organization'' property that would match the [[https://schema.org/Organization|Schema.org organization field]].

For example, in our [[:about_us|About us]] page, we have set in the [[frontmatter|frontmatter]] the following properties:
<code json>
{
	"canonical": "about",
	"title": "The ComboStrap Organization - About us",
	"description": "A page about the combostrap organization that also demonstrates how you can create an organization page",
	"type": "organization",
	"organization": {
		"name": "ComboStrap",
		"email": "support@combostrap.com",
		"slogan": "Growing the world GDP of publishers and creators",
		"address": {
			"@type": "PostalAddress",
			"addressLocality": "Oegstgeest, Netherlands",
			"postalCode": "2343KE"
		},
		"parentOrganization": {
			"@type": "organization",
			"name": "Bytle",
			"url": "https://bytle.net"
		}
	}
}
</code>
