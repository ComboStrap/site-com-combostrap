====== ComboStrap Page Metadata - Front Matter ======

===== About =====
''Front Matter'' is a dokuwiki plugin that:
  * permits to add dokuwiki metadata in a json format.
  * add metadata into the HTML page:
      * [[seo:seo|SEO]]
          * [[description|description]]
          * [[canonical|canonical]]
      * Twitter (todo)
      * Facebook (todo)

It borrows its name from the [[kb>markup:front-matter|front matter book]]





===== Example =====
Just add a block of code that:
  * starts with ''%%---json%%''
  * contains a json document
  * end with ''%%---%%''

Example:
<code javascript>
---json
{
    "canonical":"my:id",
    "description":"That's the article that you want to read!"
}
---
</code>

===== Built-in Properties =====
''Front Matter'' takes into account the below properties


===== Dokuwiki =====


Dokuwiki follows the [[http://dublincore.org/documents/dces/|Dublin Core element names]] as keys in their meta. See [[doku>metadata]]

The below table comes from [[doku>plugin:meta#data_structure|the documentation of the meta plugin]]. It is just here for information as it reflects the dokuwiki array.
