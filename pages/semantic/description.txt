====== ComboStrap Page Metadata - Description ======


===== About =====
The ''description'' is a summary of what the page is about. 

A page's description might be a sentence or two or even a short paragraph (whereas a [[title|page's title]] may be a few words or a phrase).

It's a [[:seo|seo]] [[semantic|page metadata]] that is displayed:
  * in social cards ([[twitter|twitter]], [[facebook|facebook]], [[google|Google Rich Result]])
  * in the [[#Search Engine Results Page]].




===== Articles Related =====
{{backlinks>.}}
===== Set=====
You can modify the description by adding a ''description'' property in the [[frontmatter|frontmatter]].
<code json>
{
    "description":"Would you want to  modify your meta description to rank better on the SERP page ? This is how you do it."
}
</code>


===== Search Engine Result Pages (SERP) =====

[[kb>serp|Search Engine Result Pages (SERP)]] are the pages that are shown when you query Search Engine such as Google.

The description may show up below the [[title|title]].

For the geek, technically, this component will create the following ''description'' [[kb>html:meta|HTML meta header]]
