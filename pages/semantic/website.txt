====== ComboStrap Metadata - Website (Home Page) ======


===== About =====
''WebSite'' is a [[type|page type]] that describes a website. Generally, you would have only one page of this type and it would be your [[#home page]].

A website is defined by [[https://schema.org/WebSite|semantic.org]] as a set of related web pages that are served from a single web domain.

===== Home Page =====
''ComboStrap'' sets automatically a ''website'' [[type|type]] page on your home page if not set.


We add also the search action to implements the [[https://developers.google.com/search/docs/data-types/sitelinks-searchbox|searchbox]] [[google|google rich result]]. 


===== List =====
The following [[semantic|metadata]] are automatically added to a ''website'' page:
  * ''url'', the base url
  * ''name'', the [[doku>config:title|title]]
  * ''description'', the [[semantic:tagline|tagline]]
  * ''image'', the [[docs:getting_started:4_favicon|logo]] (as png)


<note>
You can set more metadata yourself:
  * check the ''json-ld'' example and what kind of properties may be added at [[https://schema.org/WebSite|Schema.org WebSite]]
  * and go to the [[google|Google Rich Result page]] to know how.
