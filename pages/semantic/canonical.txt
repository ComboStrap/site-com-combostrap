====== Combostrap Plugin - Data Structure - Canonical URL ======


===== About =====
A ''canonical URL'' is an [[kb>identifier|identifier]] for a web page that is defined though a the [[kb>canonical/url|canonical meta property]].

It identifies uniquely a page in a domain.

The ''canonical'' value:
  * should never change (theoretically)
  * does not need to be the [[doku>pagename]]

The ''canonical'' component is a part of the [[:seo|SEO]] module.

===== How to set the canonical value ? =====

==== Manually ====

To set the canonical value, uses the [[frontmatter|frontmatter component]] and add the ''canonical'' property in the JSON document.

<code javascript>
---json
{
    "canonical":"my:canonical:id"
}
---
</code>

==== Automatically ====

This plugin can create a canonical value based on the last parts of a page ''ID''. See [[canonical_automatic]]
===== HTML HEAD properties =====
By setting a ''canonical'' value, you will get two ''head'' properties in your HTML page.

For instance:
  * if the canonical value is ''cat:post1''
  * on a page hosted at ''example.com''
the canonical head properties would become

  * for [[https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/139066?hl=en|Google]]
<code html>
<link rel="canonical" href="https://example.com/cat/post1" />
</code>
  * and for [[https://developers.facebook.com/docs/sharing/webmasters/getting-started/versioned-link/|Facebook]]
<code html>
<meta property="og:url" content="https://example.com/cat/post1" />
</code>

===== Demo =====
This page has the canonical value set to ''canonical:url'' and therefore is also available at this Canonical URL.

<wrap tip>In [[doku>|dokuwiki]], a red hyperlink means that the file does not exist but with the ''canonical'' feature, the page exists.</wrap>
