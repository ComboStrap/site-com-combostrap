====== ComboStrap Styling - Align Attribute ======



===== About =====
''align'' is an [[docs:styling:styling|styling attribute]] of the [[docs:marki|HTML superset component]]

It permits to align a [[#block|block]] on the horizontal axis.

<note tip align="center" width="fit-content">
If you want more control on the position, you may also use a [[docs:layout:component:row|grid]]
</note>


===== Syntax =====


The ''align'' attribute on a box, supports the values:
  * ''left'' or ''start'' (by default, the block is aligned to the left)
  * ''center'',
  * ''right'' or ''end''

<note>
The content will not flow along the box, if you want this behavior, you need to use the [[docs:styling:float|float attribute]]
</note>
===== Example =====

==== With a container component ====



<webcode name="Centered" >
  * Example:
<code dw>
A little bit of  content that shows that the text will not flow along the aligned box. The ''aligned'' box will then be located after this text.
<note tip align="end"  width="300px" text-align="center">
=== Block to the right ===

As every block by default takes the whole available [[dimension|width]], you need to add a [[dimension|width attribute]] when you want to align it.

</note>
</code>
  * Output:
</webcode>


<note>
=== Text ===

To align the text inside a [[docs:block:block|block component]], you use the [[docs:styling:text-align|text-align attribute]].

</note>

==== Image ====

With a [[docs:content:image|image]], if you want to align it to the ''center'', you would let a space after ''%%{{%%'' and before ''%%}}%%''. More information, see the [[docs:content:image#position|image position section]].

<webcode name="Default" frameborder=0>
<code dw>
{{ :docs:block:stock_image_surfer_in_the_see.png?400 |}}
</code>
</webcode>
