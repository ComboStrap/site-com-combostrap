====== ComboStrap Styling - Length Scale (Size Scale) ======

===== About =====
Every length are scaled based on what's called the ''[[kb>rem|rem (Root Emphemeral Unit)]]'' which is equal by default to ''16px''.




This scale is used for [[font-size|font size]] and ''spacing'' ([[docs:styling:spacing|component spacing]] and [[line-spacing|line spacing]])


The numerical scale is going:
  * from ''1'' for a length value of ''.25rem'' 
  * to ''5'' for a length value of ''3rem'' 

The alphabetical scale is going:
  * from ''xs'' (''extra-small'') for a length value of ''1rem''
  * to ''lg'' (''large'') for a length value of ''2rem''

This value is not dependent on the [[docs:styling:breakpoint|screen size]] (Bootstrap does not vary it either)
