====== ComboStrap UI - Styling ======


===== About =====
''Styling'' in ''ComboStrap'' is the possibility to render every [[docs:component|component]] as you wish.

''ComboStrap'' has three levels of styling:
  * the [[#bootstrap stylesheet|bootstrap stylesheet level]] - bootstrap standard theme
  * the [[#user_stylesheet|user stylesheet level]] - a stylesheet with custom rule to tune the styling precisely
  * the [[#attribute level]] - inline css customization
      * [[#standard|standard]] - a set of the most important attributes to quickly style any components.
      * and [[#advanced|advanced]] which let's you use the full power of HTML and CSS.



===== Levels =====

==== Bootstrap Stylesheet ====

''ComboStrap'' is based on ''Bootstrap'' and comes with pre-packaged stylesheets. You can even create and install your own bootstrap stylesheet.

==== User Stylesheet ====

This functionality gives the possibility to the web designer to create their own CSS rules in a custom stylesheet in order to tune the theme exactly to their needs.
