====== ComboStrap Styling - Breakpoint ======


===== About =====
''breakpoints prefix'' allows to apply value conditionally based on the screen size of the browser.  





===== Example =====

By adding the breakpoint as prefix, you create a value that will vary based on the screen size.

The below [[:docs:styling:spacing|spacing value]] is conditional and applies:
  * for small screen: a padding of 3 (ie ''xs-p-3'' or ''p-3'', ''xs'' being the default)
  * for medium screen ''md'' and above: a padding of 5 (ie ''md-p-5'')
<code html>
<component spacing="p-3 p-5-md" />
</code>

===== List =====

Each breakpoints defines the maximum width of the screen for a value to be applied.

^ Breakpoint ^ Prefix ^ Apply to browser size ^ Device Targeted ^

| Small | sm | ≥576px | Ipad |
