====== ComboStrap Styling - Breakpoint ======


===== About =====
''breakpoints'' allows to apply a [[docs:styling:styling|styling]] value conditionally based on the screen size of the browser.  



By adding the breakpoint name as a suffix, you create a value that will vary based on the screen size.

===== Example =====

The below [[:docs:styling:spacing|spacing value]] is conditional and applies:
  * for small screen: a padding of 3 (ie ''p-3-xs'')
  * for medium screen ''md'' and above: a padding of 5 (ie ''p-5-md'')
<code html>
<component spacing="p-3-xs p-5-md" />
</code>

===== Syntax =====

<code html>
<component attribute="value-breakpoint" />
</code>
where:
  * ''breakpoint'' is the breakpoint short name.
 
Each breakpoints defines the maximum width of the screen for a value to be applied.

^ Breakpoint ^ Short name ^ Apply to browser size ^ Device Targeted ^ 
| X-Small | xs | <576px | Mobile Phone |
| Small | sm | ≥576px | Ipad |
| Medium | md | ≥768px | Ipad Pro |
| Large (default) | lg | ≥992px | Desktop Screen |
| Extra large | xl | ≥1200px | Large Desktop Screen |
| Extra extra large \\ (new with [[docs:utility:bootstrap#version|bootstrap 5]]) | xxl | ≥1400px  | Extra Large Desktop Screen |


<note>
''combostrap'' follows the breakpoints of [[docs:utility:bootstrap|bootstrap]] (even if you have created your [[bootstrap|own custom bootstrap]])
</note>

===== Default =====
  * The default breakpoint (screen size) if not specified is ''large'' because writer designs always with a desktop screen before their eyes.
  * For the smaller breakpoints, ComboStrap applies default values that you need to overwrite.
