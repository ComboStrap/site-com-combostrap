===== List =====

''ComboStrap'' will automatically create the minimum information needed to create a ''Google Rich Result'' for the following [[docs:type:type|type of page]]:
  * [[..:type:website|website]] - The [[docs:type:index#root|root home page]] gets automatically this type of page with [[https://developers.google.com/search/docs/data-types/sitelinks-searchbox|the searchbox]] ''Rich Result''
  * [[..:type:organization|organization]] - You set this type of page in a ''About Us'' page where you gives information about your company. It enables the [[https://developers.google.com/search/docs/data-types/logo|the Google knowledge panel]] ''rich result''

===== Advanced =====

==== Manual Rich Result ====



You can also:
  * transform yourself a page to a [[https://developers.google.com/search/docs/guides/search-gallery|Google Rich Result]].
  * or set extra attributes.

You just need to:
  * set the [[docs:type:type|type of your page]] 
  * set the [[#json-ld|json-ld property]] with:
      * a full json-ld definition
      * or extra [[https://schema.org/docs/full.html|Schema.org metadata properties]] in [[https://json-ld.org|json-ld format]]


For instance, if you want to create a [[https://developers.google.com/search/docs/data-types/course|course page]], you would:
  * set the [[docs:type:type|type of your page]] to ''custom''
  * and set the [[#json-ld|json-ld property]] with the below definition:

<code json>
{
  "@context": "https://schema.org",
  "@type": "Course",
  "name": "Introduction to Computer Science and Programming",
  "description": "Introductory CS course laying out the basics.",
  "provider": {
    "@type": "Organization",
    "name": "University of Technology - Eureka",
    "sameAs": "http://www.ut-eureka.edu"
  }
}
</code>

==== json-ld ====

The ''json-ld'' property is a [[docs:metadata:metadata|page metadata]] that you can use to set extra [[https://schema.org/docs/full.html|Schema.org metadata properties]] in [[https://json-ld.org|json-ld format]]).

This metadata field is available in the ''page type'' tab of the [[docs:metadata:manager|]].
