====== Google Rich Result ======

===== About =====
The ''ComboStrap'' pages supports the setting of [[..:metadata:metadata|metadata]] to enable [[https://developers.google.com/search/docs/guides/search-gallery|Google Rich Result]].

''Google Rich Result'' are results as below shown in the search page of Google that have been [[kb>rich:text|styled]].


<box elevation="high" align="center" width="fit-content">
    {{docs:semantic:google_article_card.png?400|}}
</box>



===== List =====

''ComboStrap'' will automatically create the minimum information needed to create a ''Google Rich Result'' for the following [[docs:type:type|type of page]]:
  * [[..:type:website|website]] - The home page gets automatically this type of page with [[https://developers.google.com/search/docs/data-types/sitelinks-searchbox|the searchbox]] ''Rich Result''
  * [[..:type:organization|organization]] - You set this type of page in a ''About Us'' page where you gives information about your company. It enables the [[https://developers.google.com/search/docs/data-types/logo|the Google knowledge panel]] ''rich result''
  * [[..:type:article|article]] - An article such as a wikipedia article, news article or piece of investigative report that enables [[https://developers.google.com/search/docs/data-types/article|card]]
  * [[docs:type:event|event]] - On an event page, we add its start and end date


<note>
With the [[#json-ld|manual json-ld]] attribute, you can also set extra properties if needed
</note>
===== Preview / Control =====
You can control the ''Rich Result'' of your page with the following tools:
  * [[https://search.google.com/test/rich-results|Rich Results test]] will validate and show you the data set one page at a time.
  * [[https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/7552505|Rich result status reports]] will show you a report of your website.

===== Advanced =====

==== Manual Rich Result ====



You can also:
  * transform yourself a page to a [[https://developers.google.com/search/docs/guides/search-gallery|Google Rich Result]].
  * or set extra attributes.

You just need to:
  * set the [[docs:type:type|type of your page]]
  * set the [[#json-ld|json-ld property]] with the extra [[https://schema.org/docs/full.html|Schema.org metadata properties]] in [[https://json-ld.org|json-ld format]]).


For instance, if you create a page for a [[https://schema.org/Course|Course]] as explained on this [[https://developers.google.com/search/docs/data-types/course|Google example]], you would create the following [[..:metadata:frontmatter|frontmatter]] where:
  * the [[docs:type:type|type of your page]] was set to ''Course''
  * a [[#json-ld|json-ld property]] was created that holds the ''course'' property.

<code json>
{
  "name": "Introduction to Computer Science and Programming",
  "description": "Introductory CS course laying out the basics.",
  "provider": {
    "@type": "Organization",
    "name": "University of Technology - Eureka",
    "sameAs": "http://www.ut-eureka.edu"
  }
}
</code>

==== json-ld ====

The ''json-ld'' property is a [[docs:metadata:metadata|page metadata]] that you can use to set extra [[https://schema.org/docs/full.html|Schema.org metadata properties]] in [[https://json-ld.org|json-ld format]]).

This metadata field is available in the ''page type'' tab of the [[docs:metadata:manager|]].

<note tip>
You can validate the ''json-ld'' value with the [[https://json-ld.org/playground/|json-ld playground]]
