===== Creation =====

==== Automatic ====

''ComboStrap'' will automatically create the minimum information needed to create a ''Google Rich Result'' for the following [[..:semantic:type|type]] of page:
  * [[..:semantic:website|website]] - The home page gets automatically this type of page with [[https://developers.google.com/search/docs/data-types/sitelinks-searchbox|the searchbox]] ''Rich Result''
  * [[..:semantic:organization|organization]] - You set this type of page in a ''About Us'' page where you gives information about your company. It enables the [[https://developers.google.com/search/docs/data-types/logo|the Google knowledge panel]] ''rich result''
  * [[..:semantic:article|article]] - An article such as a wikipedia article, news article or piece of investigative report that enables [[https://developers.google.com/search/docs/data-types/article|card]]


<note>
With the [[#manual|manual json-ld]] attribute, you can also set extra properties if needed
</note>
==== Manual ====


You can also:
  * transform yourself a page to a [[https://developers.google.com/search/docs/guides/search-gallery|Google Rich Result]].
  * or set extra attributes.

You just need to:
  * set the [[..:semantic:type|type]] of your page
  * set a ''json-ld'' property with the extra [[https://schema.org/docs/full.html|Schema.org metadata properties]] in [[https://json-ld.org|json-ld format]]).


For instance, if you create a page for a [[https://schema.org/Course|Course]] as explained on this [[https://developers.google.com/search/docs/data-types/course|Google example]], you would create the following [[..:semantic:frontmatter|frontmatter]] where:
  * the [[..:semantic:type|type]] was set to ''Course''
  * a ''json-ld'' property was created that holds the ''course'' property.

<code json>
{
    "type":"Course",
    "json-ld": {
        "name": "Introduction to Computer Science and Programming",
        "description": "Introductory CS course laying out the basics.",
        "provider": {
            "@type": "Organization",
            "name": "University of Technology - Eureka",
            "sameAs": "http://www.ut-eureka.edu"
        }
}
</code>

<note tip>
You can validate the ''json-ld'' value with the [[https://json-ld.org/playground/|json-ld playground]]
</note>
===== Preview / Control =====
You can control the ''Rich Result'' of your page with the following tools:
  * [[https://search.google.com/test/rich-results|Rich Results test]] will validate and show you the data set one page at a time.
  * [[https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/7552505|Rich result status reports]] will show you a report of your website.
