====== ComboStrap - Backlink Page ======


===== About =====
A ''backlink'' is a page that [[docs:content:link|links]] to the actual page seen in the browser.

<note>
In [[docs:seo:seo|SEO]], they are called ''internal backlinks'' to make the difference with ''external backlink'' (ie link that comes from another website than yours).

In Combostrap, if not specified, a backlink is an ''internal backlink''
</note>





===== List =====


You can see them with the ''backlinks'' action of the [[docs:theme:slot:railbar|railbar]]

{{:docs:navigation:backlink_action.png|}}

===== Add them in the content of your page =====

==== Related ====

You can add them to your page as content with the [[docs:navigation:related|related component]]

Example:
**The markup**
<webcode name="Default" frameborder="0">
<code dw>
<related/>
</code>
**The output:**
</webcode>

==== Page SQL ====

The backlinks are also available in the [[docs:templating:sql|page sql]]. You can therefore list them in a [[docs:templating:iterator|iterator template]]

Example:
<code sql>
select from backlinks order by backlink_count desc
</code>
would return on this website:
<webcode name="backlinks" frameborder="0">
<iterator>
<data>select from backlinks order by backlink_count desc</data>
^ Path ^ Backlink Count ^ 
<template>
| [[$path|$title]] | $backlink_count |
</template>
</iterator>
</webcode>



===== Statistics =====

The backlinks are also available as count for each page in:
  * the [[docs:analytics:statistics|statistics data]]
  * or [[docs:templating:variable|page sql attribute]]
