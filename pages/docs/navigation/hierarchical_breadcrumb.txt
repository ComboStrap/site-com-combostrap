====== ComboStrap UI - Hierarchical Breadcrumb ======


===== About =====
A ''Hierarchical Breadcrumb'' is a [[docs:navigation:breadcrumb|breadcrumb]] that shows where the page is located in the [[:docs:page:system|page system tree]] in hierarchical order.



Combostrap offers two type of hierarchical breadcrumb:
  * ''navigation'': the full breadcrumb that should appear once in a page
  * ''typographical'': a breadcrumb that can be used in a [[:docs:templating:iterator|iterator fragment]] to show the page categories 

===== Type =====

==== Navigation ====

A navigational hierarchical breadcrumb:
  * is a [[docs:navigation:navigation|navigational component]] that reflects the hierarchy of the URL to the [[:docs:app:home|website home page]]
  * gives the reader  the possibility to navigate to the parent (ie up to the [[docs:app:home|website home page]])
  * helps the reader to find their place within a website or web application.


Illustration: Breadcrumbs are often placed horizontally [[:slot_main_header|before a page's main content (in the main header)]].
You will find it on this page at this location:

You can add a navigational hierarchical breadcrumb with the following syntax.
<webcode name="Default" frameborder="0">
<code dw>
<breadcrumb/>
</code>
The output for this page is:
</webcode>



==== Typography ====

A typographical hierarchical breadcrumb permits to print the parents pages.

This breadcrumb type can be used in a [[:docs:templating:iterator|iterator fragment]] to print the page category as subtitle.

To use it, you just need to defined the ''depth'' attribute that represents the number of levels that should be printed backward

Example:

Depth of 1 will print the parent page
  * Markup
<webcode name="Default" frameborder="0">
<code dw>
<breadcrumb depth=1/>
</code>
  * Output
</webcode>

<hr/>

Depth of 2 will print the parent and grand parent page
  * Markup
<webcode name="Default" frameborder="0">
<code dw>
<breadcrumb depth=2/>
</code>
  * Output:
</webcode>
