====== ComboStrap UI - Hierarchical Breadcrumb ======


===== About =====
A ''Hierarchical Breadcrumb'' is a [[docs:navigation:breadcrumb|breadcrumb]] that shows where the page is located in the web site tree in hierarchical order.



  * It's a [[docs:navigation:navigation|navigational component]] that reflects the hierarchy of the URL
  * It gives the reader  the possibility to navigate to the parent (ie up to the [[docs:app:home|website home page]])
  * It helps the reader to find their place within a website or web application. 


Illustration: You will find it on this page at this location:

{{docs:block:combostrap_hierarchical_breadcrumb.png?shadow=lg|}}


===== Usage =====


Breadcrumbs are often placed horizontally [[:slot_main_header|before a page's main content (in the main header)]] .

You can add a breadcrumb with the following syntax.
<webcode name="Default" frameborder="0">
<code dw>
<breadcrumb/>
</code>
The output for this page is:
</webcode>
