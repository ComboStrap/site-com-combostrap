====== ComboStrap UI - Hierarchical Breadcrumb ======


===== About =====
A ''Hierarchical Breadcrumb'' is a [[docs:navigation:breadcrumb|breadcrumb]] that shows where the page is located in the web site tree. 

It's a [[docs:navigation:navigation|navigational component]] that reflects the hierarchy of the URL and gives the reader the possibility to navigate to the parent (ie the start page).
