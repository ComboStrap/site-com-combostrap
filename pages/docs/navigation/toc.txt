====== ComboStrap UI - Table of Content (TOC) ======

===== About =====
The ''toc (table of content)'' gives to the reader an overview of your page.

The ''toc'' is composed of the [[docs:navigation:outline|outline headings]] 



===== Location =====


By default, the ''table of content'' is printed below the [[docs:page:h1|first heading]] but you can define your own placement
in the page with the ''toc'' component.

Example:
<code dw>
<toc/>
</code>


===== Disable =====

You can disable the rendering of a ''TOC'' by including the ''No toc'' tag (([[doku>toc]])) in your document:
<code dw>
~~NOTOC~~
</code>

===== Configuration =====
The TOC component supports all DokuWiki Configuration (([[doku>toc#configuration|TOC configuration]])) such as:
      *  [[doku>config:tocminheads]] - the minimum number of heading 
      * [[doku>config:maxtoclevel]] - the maximum level to print
      * [[doku>config:toptoclevel]] - the start level:
          * ''1'' = print the first heading 
          * ''2'' = don't print the first heading
