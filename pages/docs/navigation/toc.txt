====== ComboStrap UI - Table of Content (TOC) ======

===== About =====
The ''toc (table of content)'' gives to the reader an overview of your page by showing the [[docs:navigation:outline|outline headings label]] in a tree fashion.



===== Page Layout  =====

The ''toc'' is an element or not of the [[:docs:layout:page:page|page layout]].

This sections discuss what you can do if the toc is part of not of the page layout.



==== When the toc is part of the page layout ====

When the ''toc'' is part of a [[:docs:layout:page:page|page layout]], it will be shown but you can't delete the TOC with the standard ''%%~~NOTOC~~%%'' token of [[doku>toc|Dokuwiki]]. 

Why ? Because if the TOC is deleted, the layout will be broken.


==== When the toc is not part of the page layout ====

When the TOC is not part of a [[:docs:layout:page:page|page layout]], it will not be shown but you can still add it in your content with the ''toc'' component.

Example:
<webcode>
<code dw>
<toc/>
</code>
  * Output:
</webcode>


===== Configuration =====
The TOC component supports all DokuWiki Configuration (([[doku>toc#configuration|TOC configuration]])) such as:
      *  [[doku>config:tocminheads|tocminheads]] - the minimum number of heading 
      * [[doku>config:maxtoclevel|maxtoclevel]] - the maximum level to print
      * [[doku>config:toptoclevel|toptoclevel]] - the start level:
          * ''1'' = print the page title (the first heading)
          * ''2'' = don't print the page title (the first heading)
