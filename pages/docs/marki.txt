====== ComboStrap Styling - Marki Language ======

===== About =====
''ComboStrap'' implements in most of its components the ''marki'' language. It's a simplified version of the ''HTML'' language and follows the same rules.

Below, we describe the [[#syntax]], they all have in common.





===== Syntax =====
Every marki component follows this syntax
<code dw>
<component type name1="value1" ... nameN="valueN" >
<!-- content -->
</component>
</code>
where:
  * ''type'' is the [[.styling:type|type of component]]. Not every component has a type but if it's the case, you don't need to set a name for it.
  * ''nameX="valueX"'' are attributes that may be:
      * specific to this component
      * the [[#styling|styling attributes]]
      * or the [[#html|html attributes]]

<note>
  * Boolean attributes does not need any value to set them to true
  * If your value does not have space, this is not mandatory to enclose it between quotes
</note>





==== Styling ====
Every component implements also a set of [[.styling:styling|styling attributes]]

Example:
  * The tree [[docs:styling:color|colors attributes]] can be passed natively. You can write:
<code dw>
<component color="blue">
</code>
  * The dimension attributes (''width'' and ''height'') are also taken into account in each component. You can write:
<code dw>
<component width="100px">
</code>
  * [[docs:styling:styling|More  ? See the styling attributes]]

==== HTML ====

All HTML attributes are supported on every component and in particularly, you may use the:
  * [[.styling:class|class]]
  * [[docs:styling:style|style]]
for [[.styling:styling#advanced|advanced styling]]
