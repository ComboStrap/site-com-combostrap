====== ComboStrap Ads - Ad Page ======


===== About =====
An ''ad page'' is a page that contains the ''ad snippet'' (ie a bit of code that define the ad).

You can insert an ''ad page'' (ie an ad) via:
  * a [[ad|ad tag]]
  * or via the [[inarticle|auto in-article module]]

===== Articles Related =====
{{backlinks>.}}

<note warning>
Because the ''ads'' are stored as page, they are by default added to the index.

You need to set a configuration to prevent it. See [[conf]]
</note>
===== How to create an Ad Page =====
<note>
This example was done with ''Google Ad Sense'' but all ad network will work the same way and provides you at the end a ''ad snippet''.
</note>

  * After you have created an ''ad unit'', the ''ad network'' would show you the ''Ad Snippet''. For instance, with ''Google Ad Sense'':

{{docs:ads:ad_sense_snippet.png|}}

  * Copy this snippet of code
  * Create a page in the '':combostrap:ads'' namespace.
      * For a manual insertion via the [[ad|ad tag]] for instance in a sidebar, you could create the page '':combostrap:ads:insidebar''
      * For [[inarticle|in-article automatic insertion]], you would create the page '':combostrap:ads:inarticle1'' for the first ''in-article ad''
  * Finally, add the snippet between two ''html'' tag. Example:
<code dw :combostrap:ads:inarticle1>
<html>
<script async src="https://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
<ins class="adsbygoogle"
     style="display:block; text-align:center;"
     data-ad-layout="in-article"
     data-ad-format="fluid"
     data-ad-client="ca-pub-1481679052079799"
     data-ad-slot="8776594059"></ins>
<script>
     (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
</script>
</html>
