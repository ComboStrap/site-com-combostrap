''Ads'' is a module that permits to add ''Ads snippet'' (known as ''Ad Unit'') in your website.

<note >
In Advertising, ''Ad Unit'' defines:

  * and its styling (most importantly the dimensions)
</note>


===== Sub Modules =====

There is two sub modules:
  * [[ad|Ad]] - the ''ad'' ui component to add an ad via a tag in the content of a page
  * [[inarticle|Automatic in-article]] - the ''automatic in-article'' component will place automatically Ads into the content of your main page


<note warning>
Because the ''ads'' are stored as page, they are by default added to the index.

You need to set a configuration to prevent it. See [[conf]]
