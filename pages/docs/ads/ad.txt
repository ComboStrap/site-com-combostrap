====== ComboStrap Ads - Ad Tag ======


===== About =====
The ''ad tag'' is a syntax component of the [[ads|ads module]] that will insert a [[page|ad (ie ad page)]].


===== Example =====

For instance, if you want to add a ''Ad'' in the top of the [[docs:theme:slot:side_slot|side slot]], you would:
  * create a [[page|ad page]] called ''sideSlotTop''
  * and add it in your [[docs:theme:slot:side_slot|side slot]] with the following syntax
<webcode name="Default" frameborder=0 width=100% scrolling=yes externalResources="," renderingMode=story >
<code dw>
<ad name="sideSlotTop"/>
</code>

</webcode>





<note warning>
Because the ''ads'' are stored as page, they are by default added to the index.

You need to set a configuration to prevent it. See [[conf]]
</note>
===== Syntax =====

<code dw>
<ad name="adsFileName"/>
</code>
where ''adsFileName'' is the name of the [[page|ad page]].

<note info>
The ''ad'' component is a [[docs:marki|superset HTML component]] and you can style it as you want.

===== Configuration =====
