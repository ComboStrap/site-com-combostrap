====== Lightbox ======



===== About =====
A ''lightbox'' is a window that:
  * appears when you click on [[docs:content:image|image]]
  * showing the [[docs:content:image|image]] in full format 
  * against a dark background (giving more contrast and therefore more light).



===== Example =====

==== Raster Image ====

If you click on this [[docs:content:raster|raster image]] a window will appear, showing the image in full  mode (ie its natural size up to the screen size)
<webcode name="Default" frameborder="0">
<code dw>
{{:docs:block:stock_image_surfer_in_the_see.png?200|}}
</code>
</webcode>

To close the pop-up, you can click:
  * on the close button located at the top right corner
  * or on the dark background outside the image.



==== Svg ====
Because [[docs:content:svg|svg image]] may have a small intrinsic size, we have set it to be at minimal 75% of the windows size.

Example:
The below [[https://undraw.co/illustration/content_creator_re_pt5b|undraw svg image]] has a small intrinsic dimension of ''222x150'' but when clicking on it, you still get a zoom effect.

<webcode name="Default" frameborder="0">
<code dw>
{{:undraw_content_creator.svg?200|}}
</code>
</webcode>
