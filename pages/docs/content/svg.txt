====== ComboStrap UI - SVG ======


===== About =====
''Svg'' are supported natively as [[docs:content:image|image]]


They are by default [[#optimization|optimized]].

If they have:
  * a small size, they are [[#inclusion|included]] directly to the web page
  * a big size, they are:
      * [[#lazy loading|lazy loaded]]
      * and [[#injection|injected]] as markup


<note>
This features apply also to the following SVG:
  * [[docs:content:icon|icon]]
  * [[docs:styling:background#svg_cover|background svg cover]]
  * [[docs:styling:background#svg_tile|background svg tile]]
</note>


===== Syntax =====

Svg is just an image and follows therefore the same syntax than a [[docs:content:image|Image]]

<code dw>
{{[ ]svg_path?WxH&att=value[ ]}}
</code>

A ''svg'' accepts all [[docs:styling:styling|styling attributes]].

You can change the svg type with one of the below ''type'' attribute.

^ Type value ^ Default ^ Used as ^ Seen as  ^
|  | Yes | [[docs:styling:background#svg_cover|background cover]] and illustration | Illustrative Image |
| ''icon'' | | [[docs:content:icon|icon]] | Character (width = height and default to 24px) |
| ''tile''  | | [[docs:styling:background#svg_tile|background tile]] | Icon with a default dimension of 192px |


===== Example =====

==== Illustration ====

All ''svg'' are used by default as illustrative image that:
  * takes all space available
  * and are responsive

Below is an example of an illustrative image with a:
  * ''width'' of ''600px''
  * [[docs:animation:hover|hover animation]]
  * [[docs:styling:shadow|shadow]]

<webcode name="Default" frameborder="0">
<code dw>
{{ :combostrap:background:object-multicolor.svg?600&onHover=float&shadow=md |}}
</code>
</webcode>

==== Icon ====
If you don't have an icon in your library, the [[docs:content:icon|icon component]] is more suited but if you already have uploaded an icon, you can also use it with the ''svg syntax''


Example of an svg icon with a:
  * ''type=icon'' that makes it behave as an [[docs:content:icon|icon]]
  * ''size'' of 30
  * and a ''steelblue'' [[docs:styling:color|color]]


<webcode name="Default" frameborder="0">
<code dw>
{{:combostrap:icons:bs:emoji-wink.svg?30&type=icon&color=steelblue|Emoji wink}}
</code>
</webcode>


===== Features =====

==== Inclusion ====
If the SVG file has a size that is less or equal to the [[#svgMaxInlineSize]] configuration, the SVG is directly included into the HTML document as markup
Otherwise, it is added as a image.

This is a [[docs:performance:performance|performance tradeoff]] configuration between the size of your web page and the cost of downloading your SVG file.



==== Lazy Loading ====
By default all big SVG file are lazy loaded meaning that they are downloaded only when they are going to be seen (enter into the screen).

If you don't want this feature, you can disable it in the [[#configuration|configuration]].

==== Injection ====
Big SVG file are downloaded and then injected as SVG markup. It's then possible to style them with CSS property.



If you don't want this feature, you can disable it in the [[#configuration|configuration]].

==== Optimization ====
Svg Optimization is the reduction of the file size by deleting unneeded information. You can know more about this subject on the [[docs:performance:svg_optimization|dedicated page]].




===== Security =====

==== Upload permission ====

By default, the svg files cannot be uploaded because they can contain code. Only the ''admin'' user can upload a SVG.

If you want to allow users to upload a SVG, you need to:
  * set the group that is allowed to upload a SVG in the [[#svgUploadGroupName|svgUploadGroupName]] configuration.
  * add the user to this group.

==== Script deleted ====

By default, the ''script'' element is part of the [[docs:performance:svg_optimization#svgoptimizationelementstodelete|elements to delete during the optimization]], meaning that no script can be injected this way.

The ''on'' event attribute such as ''onClick'' are not.
===== Configuration =====

==== svgMaxInlineSize ====
The ''svgMaxInlineSize'' [[docs:app:configuration|configuration]] is the maximum file size until a SVG file is included directly in the web page.

With a default of ''2Kb'', all small SVG file such as [[docs:content:icon|icon]] are automatically included. The browser does not need to download them.






==== svgLazyLoadEnable ====
By default, the SVG files that have a size bigger than the [[#svgmaxinlinesize|maximum inline size]] are [[#lazy Loading|lazy loaded]]. 

This configuration permits to disable this feature.


==== svgInjectionEnable ====
If this configuration is on, the SVG files that have a size bigger than the [[#svgmaxinlinesize|maximum inline size]] are [[#injection|injected]]. 

This configuration permits to disable / enable this feature.

==== svgUploadGroupName ====
This [[docs:app:configuration|configuration]] sets the group that is allowed to upload a SVG file.

SVG file can contain code and this by default not allowed to upload a SVG.

==== svgPreserveAspectRatioDefault ====
If the [[https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG/Attribute/preserveAspectRatio|preserveAspectRatio]] attribute is not set, it will be set with the default value.

This parameter drives how the SVG will fit in its container when the screen (viewport) is resizing.

The default value at installation time is: ''xMidYMid slice'' which means that:
  * the svg image will be in the middle of X and Y
  * and will be cropped.

Other options with the [[https://www.w3.org/TR/SVG11/coords.html#PreserveAspectRatioAttribute|Svg Reference]] or at [[https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG/Attribute/preserveAspectRatio|the mozilla knowledge base]]
