''Content'' are components that permit to fill of the content of a page. They are also known as visual and rich character text as you can use them in paragraphs.

[[docs:component|ComboStrap UI]] gets the following content components in its library:

<iterator>
  <data>select from descendants order by name</data>
^ Name ^ Description ^
<fragment>
| [[$path|$name]] | $title |
</fragment>
</iterator>
  

They are known as content components because they add content to your page.
The other big category of the component are [[:docs:layout:component:start|layout component]] which lay your content out.
