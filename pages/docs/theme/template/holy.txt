====== The Holy template ======


===== About =====

The holy [[docs:theme:template:template|template]] is the fully responsive layout known also as the ''holy grail'' with:
  * a page header and footer
  * a content header and footer
  * a sidebar


The main content width expands to the width of the page if the sidebar is not present.

This is the default layout for a [[docs:page:system:item|page item]].

===== Custom =====

You can custom it with:
  * a [[docs:theme:slot:header_slot|page header slot]]
  * a [[docs:theme:slot:footer_slot|page footer slot]]
  * and three columns:
      * [[docs:theme:slot:side_slot|left slot (page side)]]
      * [[..:slot:main|main slot (ie content)]] (main header and footer slot)

===== Containment =====

They are all [[docs:theme:slot:container|contained]] in a page that is:
  * centered 
  * with a width adjusted by screen size (by breakpoint)
