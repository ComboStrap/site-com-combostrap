====== ComboStrap UI - Table of Content (TOC) ======

===== About =====
The ''toc (table of content)'' gives to the reader an overview of your page by showing the [[docs:navigation:outline|outline headings label]] in a tree fashion.

===== Example =====

The Table of Content of this page is:

<webcode>
<code dw display="none">
<toc/>
</code>
</webcode>

===== How to add or delete a TOC? =====

The ''toc'' is an element or not of a [[docs:theme:template:template|template]].

You can:
  * add it by choosing a template that supports a TOC.
  * delete it by choosing a template that does not support a TOC.


By default, all templates support a toc with the exception of the templates created for [[:docs:page:system:index|index pages]].



===== Configuration =====
The TOC component supports all DokuWiki Configuration (([[doku>toc#configuration|TOC configuration]])) such as:
      *  [[doku>config:tocminheads|tocminheads]] - the minimum number of heading 
      * [[doku>config:maxtoclevel|maxtoclevel]] - the maximum level to print
      * [[doku>config:toptoclevel|toptoclevel]] - the start level:
          * ''1'' = print the page title (the first heading)
          * ''2'' = don't print the page title (the first heading)
