====== ComboStrap - Main Template Element ======


===== About =====
In the [[..:template:template|page layout]], the ''main element'' is where the content of your page is rendered. 



===== Main Header and Footer =====

In a template, the ''main element'' may have a:
  * [[..:slot:main_header_slot|header]], located at its top 
  * and [[..:slot:main_footer_slot|footer]], located at its bottom 

This slots are mostly used for [[docs:templating:templating|templating]].

For instance, you could add for each page:
  * the [[docs:navigation:hierarchical_breadcrumb|hierarchical breadcrumb]] in the ''main header''
  * a [[docs:social:share|share button]] in the ''main footer''
  * or any other component.
