      * [[:docs:navigation:backlink|backlinks]]
      * sibling

===== How to change it? =====

By default, the ''main footer'' design is implemented by the [[:docs:theme:template:template|template]].
Power users can overwrite it by creating a [[:docs:theme:slot:main_footer_slot|main footer slot]].

Note that not all templates support a ''main footer''. 

By default, all templates that are **not** for a [[:docs:theme:template:index|index page]] such as the [[:docs:theme:template:index|index template]] should support it. You should refer to the documentation of the template to confirm it.
