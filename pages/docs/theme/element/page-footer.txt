===== How to change it? =====

By default, the ''page-footer'' design is implemented by the [[:docs:theme:template:template|template]].

  * Designers can [[:howto:theme-creation|create a custom theme]] and apply complex HTML logic.
  * Power users can overwrite it by creating a [[:docs:theme:slot:page_footer_slot|page footer slot]].


Most of the templates should support it except the [[:docs:theme:template:blank|blank layout]]. You should refer to the documentation of the template to confirm it.
