====== ComboStrap - Page Footer Template Element ======

===== About =====
The ''page footer'' template element is located at the bottom of a page that contains the footer of the [[..:template:template|page]].

It's also known as a ''fat footer'' and contains generally information about the [[docs:app:app|web site]].

===== Customization =====

==== Slot System ====

With the [[docs:theme:slot:slot|slot system]], you can create a document with the name ''slot_footer'' (by default) to create your own.

Example: with:
  * two cells in a [[docs:layout:component:grid|grid]] that will show them:
    * on 1 row on a large screen 
    * on 2 rows on mobile 
  * inside a [[:docs:layout:component:bar|bar]] to style the background with a [[docs:styling:color#gradient|gradient color]] and a little bit of [[docs:styling:spacing|spacing]]


<webcode name="Default" frameborder=0 width=100% renderingMode=story >
<code dw>
<bar class="p-3" background-color="gradient-light">

<grid>

<box>
**First Cell** \\
Powered by [[:start|ComboStrap]] \\
[[support@combostrap.com?subject=Contact via WebSite|support@combostrap.com]] \\
</box>

<box>
**Second Cell** \\
[[#|Security]]\\
[[#|Release (Changes)]]\\
</box>
</grid>
</bar>
</code>

This code will output the following:
</webcode>

==== Template Customization ====
You can also [[:howto:theme-creation|create your own theme]] and apply complex HTML logic.

===== Configuration =====
By default, the name of the footer slot page is ''slot_footer''.

But you can change it with the ''tpl»strap»footerSlotPageName'' [[docs:app:configuration|configuration]]
