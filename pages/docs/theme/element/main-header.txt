It is generally shown prominently to grab the attention of your reader.

  * the [[:docs:page:title|page title]]
  * the [[:docs:page:lead|lead]]
  * a [[:docs:page:featured-image|featured image]]
  * the [[:docs:navigation:breadcrumb|breadcrumb]]


===== How to change it? =====

By default, the ''main header'' design is implemented by the [[:docs:theme:template:template|template]].
Power users can overwrite it by creating a [[:docs:theme:slot:main_header_slot|main header slot]].

Note that not all templates support a ''main header''. 

By default, all templates that are **not** for a [[:docs:theme:template:index|index page]] such as the [[:docs:theme:template:index|index template]] should support it. You should refer to the documentation of the template to confirm it.
