====== Branding Colors (primary, secondary) ======



===== About =====
''branding colors'' are a set of principal <icon name="bi:palette-fill" width="16"/> [[docs:styling:color|colors]] that determines your [[..:app:branding|brand]] visually.

They should be the most used colors in your [[:docs:theme:theme|theme]].

In ComboStrap, they are called:
  * ''primary''
  * ''secondary''

The ''primary'' color is the color
  * displayed most frequently with the most importance
  * that should have the most lightness and saturation

The ''secondary'' color is the second color in importance and is used to give another color accent if your theme is dual tone.



===== Usage =====

They are:
  * used in the [[docs:menubar:brand|brand button]] by default
  * advertised in the [[docs:app:manifest|app manifest]]
  * the admin page (icon, link)


===== Color Name Precedence =====

When the color are set, they will take precedence:
  * as [[docs:styling:color|color name]]
  * and as color type.

For instance, a [[docs:content:button|button]]:
  * that has the ''primary'' type has default
  * will take the ''primary'' color of this installation (ie ''#7611F7'')

<webcode >
<code dw>
<btn>[[#|A button with the default primary color]]</btn>
</code>
  * Output:
</webcode>

===== Branding Color Inheritance =====

The branding color inheritance is a feature that will apply automatically the primary color to the following component.
  * [[docs:content:icon|icon]] (with a size above two [[docs:styling:scale|2rem]] or used as illustration)
  * [[docs:content:highlight|highlight]] (light based)
  * [[docs:content:link|link]] (gray based only in main content)
  * [[docs:app:identity|identity forms focus and button (login, register, resend, ...) ]]

You can [[#disable_the_branding_color_inheritance|disable this feature in the configuration]].


<note>
For [[docs:seo:seo|SEO purpose]], we make sure that the contrast ratio is enough for best readability (if not, we change it to go above the minimum of 4.5 (([[https://web.dev/color-contrast/|Contrast ratio minimum]] ))
</note>
===== Configuration =====

==== Colors ====

You can set the brand colors in the [[docs:app:configuration|configuration]] with the ''primary-color'' and ''secondary-color''  property.

==== Disable the branding color inheritance ====

You can disable the inheritance of the branding colors with the ''brandingColorInheritanceEnable'' [[docs:app:configuration|configuration]]. The [[docs:theme:bootstrap|color of the bootstrap stylesheet]] will then take over.
