===== About =====
''slot'' are placeholders in the template that are filled with the content of a markup / wiki file.

ComboStrap supports the following slots:
  * the [[docs:theme:element:main|primary slot (known also as main)]], the slot that contains the main content of the page
  * the secondary slots, the slots that are optional to create a page.

The table below lists all supported secondary slots and their type.

^ Name ^ Location ^ Slot Type ^
| [[docs:theme:slot:side_slot|side slot]] | at the left side of the primary slot | Page |
| [[docs:theme:slot:header_slot|header slot]] | at the top of a page | Page |
| [[docs:theme:element:page-footer|footer slot]] | at the bottom of a page | Page |
| [[release:deprecated:sidekick_slot|sidekick slot]] | at the right of the primary slot | Content |
| [[main_header_slot|main header slot]] | at the top of the primary slot | Content |
| [[main_footer_slot|main footer slot]] | at the bottom of the primary slot | Content |




===== Secondary Slots Usage =====

You can list, edit or create secondary slots with the [[docs:theme:slot:slot_manager|slot manager]].

The secondary slot works like that:
  * if you want to fill the [[docs:theme:slot:side_slot|side slot]] for the whole website, you would create the ''side slot'' page at the root of the [[docs:page:system:system|page system]] (by default the ''sidebar'' page)
  * if you want to fill the [[docs:theme:slot:side_slot|side slot]] only  for a specific [[docs:page:system:namespace|namespace]], you would create the  ''side slot'' page under this namespace (for instance: ''namespace:sidebar'')

The [[docs:theme:slot:slot_manager|slot manager]] shows you where you can create this slots.


Features:
  * A ''secondary slot'' can be defined for every namespace (directory). If there is no ''slot'' page for a namespace, a  ''slot'' page is searched in the ascendant namespace (parent, grand parent,...)
  * A ''secondary slot'' is automatically [[docs:quality:automatic_hidden|hidden]] and not searchable.
  * [[docs:cache:slot|Side slots (side and sidekick slots)]] are rendered for every namespace and regenerated for each namespace changes (page creation, modification, deletion)


===== Glossary =====

==== Bar vs Slot ====

In ComboStrap, a ''slot'' is a place in the template where content can be added while a ''bar'' is a UI component such as the [[docs:menubar:menubar|menu bar]].
