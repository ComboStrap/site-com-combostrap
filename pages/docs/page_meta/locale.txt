====== ComboStrap Page Metadata - Locale ======

===== About =====
The ''locale'' is a [[..:semantic:semantic|page metadata]] that contains a language and a country identifier.


Example with the default value for [[..:social:facebook|facebook]] for the ''english'' language in the ''united state'' country.
<code>
en_US
</code>

It's used for localization filtering:
  * by search engine to filter the search result ([[..:social:google|Google]], ...)
  * by social engine to filter the newsfeed ([[..:social:twitter|twitter]], [[..:social:facebook|facebook]], ...).

===== Set =====

The ''locale'' can not be set directly because it's a derived value from:
  * the [[lang|language identifier]]
  * and the [[country|country identifier]]

This two values needs to be known to have a ''locale''.
