====== ComboStrap Page Metadata - Automatic Canonical ======


===== About =====
This feature creates automatically a [[canonical|canonical value]] (ie a page identifier) based on the last part of a [[doku>pagename|DokuWiki Id]].

<note info>
There is no automatic canonical created for the [[docs:layout:page:slot|slots]] as they are not intended to be accessed directly.
</note>
===== Articles Related =====
{{backlinks>.}}

===== Example =====
For example, if you have a [[doku>pagename|Dokuwiki Id]] with the value
<file>
seo:backlink
</file>
This feature will:
  * not create a [[canonical|canonical]] if the [[#configuration|minimal number of name configuration]] is 0
  * create a [[canonical|canonical]] of:
      * ''backlink'' if the [[#configuration|minimal number of name configuration]] is 1
      * ''seo:backlink'' if the [[#configuration|minimal number of name configuration]] is 2

===== Configuration =====
If the [[:configuration|configuration]] ''BestEndPageMinimalScoreForIdRedirect'' has a value of:
  * ''0'' disable this features
  * ''1'' will create a [[canonical|canonical]] with the first last name part
  * ''2'' will create a [[canonical|canonical]] with the last two name parts

<note tip>
  * For small website, this configuration is set to 1
  * For bigger website, this configuration is set to 2
To have a value above 2 is not really common and should be avoided.
