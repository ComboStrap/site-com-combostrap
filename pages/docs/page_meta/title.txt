====== ComboStrap Page Metadata - Title ======

===== About =====

''ComboStrap'' can manage the meta ''title'' of a web page. It's also known as the page ''headline''.

A page's title may be a few words or a phrase (whereas a [[description|page's description]] might be a sentence or two or even a short paragraph. 

In the [[https://developers.google.com/search/docs/beginner/seo-starter-guide#create-good-titles-and-snippets-in-search-results|Google SEO start guide title section]], Google recommends to create title that are:
  * ''Accurate'' (that describe the page's content)
  * ''Unique'' for each page
  * ''Brief'' but ''descriptive''


This ''title'' will:
  * show up in the ''Search Engine Result Pages (SERP)'' (the results that you see when querying Google)
  * show up in the title bar at the top of the web browser, 
  * show up in [[docs:social:social|social]] cards such as [[..:social:twitter|twitter]], [[..:social:google|google]]  or [[..:social:facebook|facebook]]
  * be used when someone bookmarks the page.
  * be used in ''text-to-speech (TTS)'' (thanks to [[https://developers.google.com/search/docs/data-types/speakable|Speakable]])

===== Processing =====

==== With Dokuwiki ====

For [[doku>|Dokuwiki]], 
  * by default, the title of a page is the [[doku>pagename|DokuWiki Id]] with the the [[doku>config:title|title configuration]]
  * If the [[doku>config:useheading|useheading]] [[:configuration|configuration]] is on, the first [[docs:content:heading|heading]] is used to replace the [[doku>pagename|DokuWiki Id]]

==== With ComboStrap ====
<note warning>
The [[:strap|Strap template]] is mandatory or a template should take into account the ''title'' metadata.
</note>

With [[:start|ComboStrap]], if you set a ''title'' property with [[..:semantic:frontmatter|frontmatter]], it will become the page title.

Example:
<code javascript>
{
    "title":"Page title (Set by Combostrap)"
}
</code>
Result:

<note>
With the [[:strap|strap template]],  the website ''home page'' title is the Dokuwiki title with the website [[docs:app:tagline|tagline]]
