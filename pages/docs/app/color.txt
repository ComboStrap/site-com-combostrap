====== Branding Colors (primary, secondary) ======



===== About =====
''branding colors'' are a set of principal [[docs:styling:color|colors]] that determines your [[branding|brand]] visually.

They should be the most used colors in your [[docs:styling:stylesheet|theme]].

In ComboStrap, they are called:
  * ''primary''
  * ''secondary''

The ''primary'' color is the color 
  * displayed most frequently with the most importance
  * that should have more lightness and saturation

The ''secondary'' color is the color that:
  * has:
      * less [[docs:styling:emphasis|emphasis]] (importance) than the primary color
      * more [[docs:styling:emphasis|emphasis]] than the text
  * is:
      * darker than the primary color 
      * lighter than the text
  * is used as default for:
      * [[docs:content:icon|icon character]] 
      * all second elements such as a second button.

===== Usage =====

They are:
  * used in the [[docs:menubar:brand|brand button]] by default
  * advertised in the [[docs:app:manifest|app manifest]]
  * the admin page (icon, link)

They are also inherited by default on the following components:
  * [[docs:content:button|button]], 
  * [[docs:content:icon|icon]]
  * [[docs:content:highlight|highlight]]
  * [[docs:content:link|link]]




<webcode >
Example:
  * A default button will take the ''primary'' color of this installation (ie ''#7611F7'')
<code dw>
<btn>[[#|A button with the default primary color]]</btn>
</code>
  * Output:
</webcode>
===== Configuration =====

==== Colors ====

You can set the brand colors in the [[docs:app:configuration|configuration]] with the ''primary-color'' and ''secondary-color''  property.

==== Disable the branding color inheritance ====

You can disable the inheritance of the branding colors with the ''brandingColorInheritanceEnable'' [[docs:app:configuration|configuration]]. The [[docs:styling:stylesheet|color of the bootstrap stylesheet]] will then take over.

===== Example =====

The image below shows as example a list of primary/secondary colors that are the basic block for a [[docs:styling:stylesheet|theme]].
