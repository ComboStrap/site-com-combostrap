====== Branding Colors (primary, secondary) ======



===== About =====
''branding colors'' are a set of principal [[docs:styling:color|colors]] that determines your [[branding|brand]] visually.

They should be the most used colors in your [[docs:styling:stylesheet|theme]].

In ComboStrap, they are called:
  * ''primary''
  * ''secondary''

The ''primary'' color is the color 
  * displayed most frequently with the most importance
  * that should have the most lightness and saturation

The ''secondary'' color is the second color in importance and is used to give another color accent if your theme is dual tone.



===== Usage =====

They are:
  * used in the [[docs:menubar:brand|brand button]] by default
  * advertised in the [[docs:app:manifest|app manifest]]
  * the admin page (icon, link)

===== Branding Color Inheritance =====

The branding color inheritance is a feature that will apply automatically the primary color to the following component.
  * [[docs:content:button|button]], 
  * [[docs:content:icon|icon]] (with a size above two [[docs:styling:scale|2rem]])
  * [[docs:content:highlight|highlight]] (light based)
  * [[docs:content:link|link]] (gray based only in main content)

You can [[#disable_the_branding_color_inheritance|disable this feature in the configuration]].

<webcode >
Example:
  * A default button will take the ''primary'' color of this installation (ie ''#7611F7'')
<code dw>
<btn>[[#|A button with the default primary color]]</btn>
</code>
  * Output:
</webcode>

<note>
For [[docs:seo:seo|SEO purpose]], we make sure that the contrast ratio is enough for best readability (if not, we change it to go above the minimum of 4.5 (([[https://web.dev/color-contrast/|Contrast ratio minimum]] ))
</note>
===== Configuration =====
