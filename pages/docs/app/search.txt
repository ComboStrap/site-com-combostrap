====== Internal Search Engine ======


===== About =====
The ''internal search engine'' permits to search a page via search term.

The basic way to add it is to add the [[docs:menubar:search|search component]] in the menubar.


===== Integration =====

==== Browser ====

The internal search engine is advertised to the browser
  * When a user starts to type the name of a website  in the address bar (''alt+D'')
  * It will see a ''Search WebSite'' box
  * When typing the ''tab'' key, it will then be able to enter a ''search term''
  * Typing the ''enter'' key will then bring the user to the ''search'' page of this website.

Demo:

<note>The user doesn't need to go to a page and uses the [[docs:menubar:search|search box]]</note>

==== Google ====

The internal search engine is advertised to the Google Search Engine via the [[docs:type:website|website page type]].

==== Redirection ====

Internally, if a URL is not found, the user is [[docs:router:search_engine|redirected to the search engine]].
