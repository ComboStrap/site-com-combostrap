====== ComboStrap - Identity Management ======


===== About =====
''identity management'' is based on the [[doku>acl|Dokuwiki Acl module and plugins]]. 



''ComboStrap'' adds styling to the identity forms:
  * [[#login]]
  * [[#registration]]
  * [[#resend Password]]
  * [[#profile|Profile (update and delete)]]


===== Forms =====

==== Login ====

The [[doku>login]] form shows:
  * a username
  * a password
  * and an ''remember me'' check box if the [[doku>config:rememberme|rememberme configuration]] is equal to one.

==== Registration ====

The [[doku>login#registration|Registration form]] will shows:
  * a username
  * a password and its confirmation (if the [[doku>config:autopasswd|automatic password feature]] is not enabled)
  * a real name 
  * and an email field

==== Resend Password ====

The ''resend password'' will shows only one field, the username.

==== Profile ====

The ''profile'' page has two forms:
  * an ''update'' form to update the user information
  * a ''delete'' form to delete the account

For the ''update'' form, with the [[doku>config:profileconfirm]] [[:configuration|configuration]], you can require that a user confirm their current password in order to update their profile.
===== Configuration =====

==== Logo ====
The ''enableLogoOnIdentityForms'' permits to enable or disable the rendering of the [[docs:getting_started:5_favicon|logo]] to render on the page.

==== Enable / Disable Forms ====
All forms are disabled, if the [[doku>acl|acl module]] is disabled.

You can also if you want to get back to the original forms, disable the rendering of the forms individually with the following [[:configuration|configuration]]:
  * ''enableLoginForm''
  * ''enableRegistrationForm''
  * ''enableResendPwdForm''
  * ''enableProfileUpdateForm''
  * ''enableProfileDeleteForm''
