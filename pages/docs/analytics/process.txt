====== ComboStrap Analytics - Process ======


===== About =====
The ''analytics process'' is the process that creates the [[data|analytical data]] and this page gives more insight about this process.



===== Articles Related =====
{{backlinks>.}}
===== Update =====
Because this is a intensive process, it happens slowly:
  * for every page visited 
  * or for every page that gains or lost backlinks.
And the output is [[#cache|cached]].

If you want to update all pages in batch, you can do it with the [[#cli]] on the server.


===== Cache =====

To purge the analytical cache, you can:
  * run the [[#cli|cli]]
  * do it manually for one page by adding the following query ''?do=export_combo_analytics&purge=true''. See [[doku>devel:caching#purging_the_cache|the dokuwiki doc]]
  * modifying a [[:configuration|configuration]] forth and back. The update of the configuration file purges the current cache.


===== Cli =====
On the server, you can update the analytical data with the following command
<code bash>
cd $DOKUWIKI_HOME
./bin/plugin.php combo analytics
</code>

===== Monitoring =====

==== The last pages analyzed ====

You can monitor the process by [[query|querying]] on the ''date'' field.

Example:
<code sql>
select
	id,
	json_extract(analytics, '$.date') as date
from
	pages
order by date desc
limit 10;
</code>

==== The pages to be analyzed ====
The pages to analyze are stored in the table ''analtyics_to_refresh''.

If you query this table, you would get all page that should be analyzed in the near future.
<code sql>
select * from analtyics_to_refresh
