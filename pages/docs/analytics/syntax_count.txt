====== Page Statistic - Syntax Count (Component count) ======


===== About =====
''syntax_count'' is an [[statistics|statistics]] that shows the number of times a syntax (ie component) is used.

You can then analyse the syntax of your page.

===== Example =====

==== For one page ====
Asking for the [[statistics|json statistics]] of a page, you would see a list of key / pair properties where:
  * the key is the syntax
  * the value is the number of occurrence on the page


<code json>
"syntax_count": {
	"p": 8,
	"combo_frontmatter": 1,
	"section": 5,
	"monospace": 21,
	"combo_link": 7,
	"combo_badge": 1,
	"combo_code": 2,
	"table": 1,
	"tablethead": 1,
	"tablerow": 2,
	"tableheader": 5,
	"tablecell": 5,
	"combo_button": 1,
	"listu": 2,
	"listitem": 16,
	"listcontent": 16
}

==== SQL  analytics ====

This SQL is an example that shows all pages that have a [[docs:content:button|button]]

<code sql>
select
	id,
	json_extract(analytics, '$.statistics.syntax_count.combo_button') as button_count
from
	pages
where json_extract(analytics, '$.statistics.syntax_count.combo_button') is not null
order by id
