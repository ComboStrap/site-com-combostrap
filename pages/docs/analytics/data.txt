====== ComboStrap Analytics - Data (JSON) ======


===== About =====
''ComboStrap'' performs regularly analytical calculation on pages.


===== Format =====
The analytical data are composed of three parts:
  * [[docs:semantic:semantic|metadata]]: the metadata
  * [[statistics|statistics]] : page statistics such as words_count, links, header
  * [[docs:quality:quality|quality]] data:
      * ''low'' is the [[docs:quality:low_quality_page|low quality page]] indicator
      * ''quality score'' data
      * [[docs:quality:rule|quality rule information]]


===== Access =====

This data are accessible:
  * via the [[#database|database]]
  * or via an [[#url|URL]]

==== URL ====

You can get the analytical data as ''json'' with an export.

  * via a direct URL by by adding ''?do=export_combo_analytics'' to a page URL. For instance, to get the data of the actual page, click on this [[?do=export_combo_analytics|link]]
  * via the ''Analytics'' menu item by clicking on the following icon <icon name="file-chart"/> (only for logged user) 


<note>
The analytical process is done only when the file has changed. If you want to perform it again or overcome the cache, add to your URL, the following query parameter: ''&purge=true''
</note>
==== Database ====
The Analytical data are stored in the [[database|database]] in the ''analytics'' column of the ''page'' table in a ''json'' format. You can then query it with the [[https://www.sqlite.org/json1.html|json function of SQLite]].

For instance, you can then execute a query such as the following that extracts [[docs:quality:low_quality_page|low quality pages]] and their ''words'' and ''links'' statistics
<code sql >
select
	id,
	json_extract(analytics,'$.quality.failed_mandatory_rules') as failed_rules,
	json_extract(analytics,'$.statistics.words_count') as words,
	json_extract(analytics,'$.statistics.internal_links_count') as internal_links,
	json_extract(analytics,'$.statistics.internal_backlinks_count') as internal_backlinks
from
	pages
where
json_extract(analytics, '$.quality.low') = true
