====== ComboStrap - Analytics and database replication ======


===== About =====
The ''database replication process'' is the process that creates the [[data|analytical data]] if needed and replicates the data with the [[docs:analytics:database|database]].




===== Update =====
Because this is a intensive process, it happens slowly:
  * for every page visited 
  * or for every page that gains or lost backlinks.
And the output is [[#cache|cached]].

If you want to update all pages in batch, you can do it with the [[#cli]] on the server.


===== Cache =====

To purge the analytical cache, you can:
  * run the [[#cli|cli]]
  * do it manually for one page by adding the following query ''?do=export_combo_analytics&purge=true''. See [[doku>devel:caching#purging_the_cache|the dokuwiki doc]]
  * modifying a [[docs:app:configuration|configuration]] forth and back. The update of the configuration file purges the current cache.


===== Cli =====
On the server, you can [[docs:admin:replication|replicate the data]] to the database with the [[:docs:admin:cli|cli]] following command
<code bash>
cd $DOKUWIKI_HOME
# optional (for farm)
animal=animal-directory-name
# command
php ./bin/plugin.php combo metadata-to-database
</code>

===== Monitoring =====

==== The replication date ====

The replication date is stored in the ''date_replication'' metadata and can be seen via:
  * the [[docs:metadata:manager|metadata manager]] (integration tab)
  * the [[docs:metadata:viewer|Metadata Viewer]].
  * or [[query|query]] .
<code sql>
select
	path,
	date_replication
from
	pages
order by date desc
limit 10;
</code>


==== The analytics date ====

You can see the analytics date on the ''date'' field of the [[data|JSON object]]

Example of [[query|query]] .
<code sql>
select
	path,
	json_extract(analytics, '$.date') as date
from
	pages
order by date desc
limit 10;
</code>

==== Replication Request ====
When [[docs:navigation:backlink|backlinks]] are added or deleted, a replication request of the page is asked to update them.


This request are stored in the table ''pages_to_replicate''. If you query this table, you would get all page that should be replicated in the near future. This table should be empty 99% of the time as this is a temporary table.
<code sql>
select * from pages_to_replicate
