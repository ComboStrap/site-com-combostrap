====== ComboStrap Analytics - Page Statistics ======


===== About =====
The ''ComboStrap Page Statistics'' are a list of ''page statistics'' that are available in the [[data|analytical data]].


===== Example Words Summary =====
For instance, if you want to get statistics over ''words'', you could [[query|execute]] the below query.
<code sql>
select
	count(*) as page_count,
	round(avg(word_count)) as words_avg,
	sum(word_count) as words_count,
	max(word_count) as words_max,
	min(word_count) as words_min
from
	(
	select
		id,
		json_extract(analytics, '$.statistics.word_count') as word_count
	from
		pages
	where
		analytics is not null
)
</code>

And this is the result that we get on this website.

^ page_count ^ words_avg ^ words_count ^ words_max ^ words_min ^
|268|181|45933|1301|11|
