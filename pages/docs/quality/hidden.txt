====== ComboStrap Quality - Hidden Page ======


===== About =====
A ''hidden'' resource (page, image, file, ...) is a resource that is:
  * not published to [[kb>search:engine|Search Engine]] (ie not included in the [[:sitemap|sitemap]] and not pinged)
  * not included 
      * in the [[docs:navigation:page-explorer|page-explorer pane]]
      * in the change log feeds
  * not visible:
      * when searching
      * in internal backlinks.

<note>
In short, the page is still accessible directly (with its URL) but is no more visible.
