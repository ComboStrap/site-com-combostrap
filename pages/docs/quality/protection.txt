  * they should not be published publicly 
  * or are protected.

  * [[..:seo:lqpp#protection mode|low quality pages]]
  * pages with a [[lpp|published date in the past]]

This configuration has the following possibilities:
  * ''norobot'': The page will be protected from search engine (aka ''robots'')
      * The page will not be added to the search engine index
      * The page will not appear in the [[docs:seo:sitemap|sitemap]].
  * [[docs:quality:hidden|Hidden]] (default) - The page is still accessible directly but is not advertised. A visitor coming from an external link (such as external backlinks or email) will be able to see the page but the page will not be available in any listing.
