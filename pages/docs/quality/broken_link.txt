====== ComboStrap Quality - Broken links ======


===== About =====
A ''broken link'' is a internal link that points to:
  * a [[docs:router:404|non-existing page]]
  * or a non-existing media (such as an [[docs:content:image|image]])

They hurt your [[docs:seo:seo|SEO]] and should be avoided at all cost.

You can [[dynamic_monitoring|monitor them]] and you can even [[#list|list them]]


===== List =====
You can [[docs:analytics:query|query the database]] against the [[docs:analytics:statistics|page statistics data]] with the below Analytics SQL to list the page with broken links and their count along with the [[docs:page:path|path of the page]]
<code sql>
select
	path,
	json_extract(analytics, '$.statistics.internal_broken_links_count') as broken_link,
	json_extract(analytics, '$.statistics.media.internal_broken_count') as broken_media
from
	pages
where
	json_extract(analytics, '$.statistics.internal_broken_links_count') is not null
	or json_extract(analytics, '$.statistics.media.internal_broken_count') != 0
