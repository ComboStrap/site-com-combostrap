====== ComboStrap Quality - Broken links ======


===== About =====
A ''broken link'' is a internal link that points to:
  * a [[docs:url:404|non-existing page]]
  * or a non-existing media (such as an [[docs:content:image|image]])

They hurt your [[docs:seo:seo|SEO]] and should be avoided at all cost.

You can [[dynamic_monitoring|monitor them]] and you can even [[#list|list them]]
