====== ComboStrap Quality - Dynamic Page Monitoring ======


===== About =====
''Dynamic Quality Page Monitoring'' is a feature that encourages the ''writer'' (users with edit permission) to improve the [[score|quality score]] of its page.

The writer sees in the [[docs:layout:page:railbar|railbar]] an alert icon <icon name="alert" color="#ffc107"/> in place of the normal quality icon <icon name="seal" color="#ccc"/>  that indicates that the page is of [[docs:quality:low_quality_page|low quality]].

If you click on the action, the writer will see the [[rule|quality rules]] that don't pass.

For a page that is not an article such as home page or landing page, you can also [[#disable_for_a_page|disable it]].




===== Example =====

For the low quality page demo ([[low_quality_example|low quality demo page]]), you would get the below note if you had the ''edit'' authorization.

<note>
<quality page-id="docs:quality:low_quality_example"/>
</note>


===== Configuration =====
==== Excluded Quality Rules ====
The [[docs:app:configuration|configuration]] ''excludedQualityRulesFromDynamicMonitoring'' lists the [[rule|quality rules]] that should not be monitored.

If you had a [[rule|quality rule]] in this list, it will not show up in the message.


==== Disable for a page ====

You can disable the ''dynamic quality monitoring'' feature by setting the property ''dynamic_quality_monitoring'' in the [[docs:metadata:manager|metadata manager]] to ''false''.


==== Disable totally ====

You can disable totally the ''dynamic quality monitoring'' feature by selecting the [[docs:app:configuration|configuration disableDynamicQualityMonitoring]].
