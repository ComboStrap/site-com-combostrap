====== Featured Image ======
{{:docs:page:featured_image.jpg|}}



===== About =====
A ''featured image'' is a page's main [[docs:page:image|illustrative image]].

The featured image is generally located below or above the [[:docs:page:title|page tile]].


===== Type =====

We support two types of featured images:
  * [[:docs:content:raster|raster]] that are suitable for [[:docs:social:social|social network]]
  * [[:docs:content:svg|svg]] that are suitable for design where you can apply your own style


===== Default =====

When scanning the content, we derived the ''featured images'' and we set the default value accordingly.


^ [[docs:theme:template:template|Template]] \\ with [[:docs:theme:slot:main_header_slot|main header]] ^ Applied generally \\ to the following pages ^ Default Value ^
| Yes | [[:docs:page:system:item|Item pages]] | the direct children images found just after the [[:docs:page:h1|first heading]] |
| No | [[docs:page:system:index|Index pages]] | the [[first-image|first image]] found on the page |


If no featured image is found:
  * the featured image of the [[:docs:page:system:system|parent until the root]] is used if any
  * and if none is found, the [[:docs:app:logo|logo]] is used in last resort.


===== How to set your featured images? =====

If you are not happy with the [[#default|default value]], you can set your featured images via the [[:docs:metadata:manager|metadata manager]].
