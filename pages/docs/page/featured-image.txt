====== Featured Image ======
{{:docs:page:featured_image.jpg|}}



===== About =====
A ''featured image'' is the main [[docs:page:image|illustrative image]] of a page.

The featured image is generally located below or above the [[:docs:page:title|page tile]].

===== How to set a featured image? =====

==== Via the content ====
When scanning the content, we derived the ''featured image'' and we set the default value accordingly.

  * for an [[:docs:page:system:index|index page]], the ''featured image'' is the first image found on the page.
  * for an [[:docs:page:system:item|item page]], the ''featured image'' is the image found just after the [[:docs:page:h1|first heading]] if present.

==== Via the metadata manager ====

You can set a featured image via the [[:docs:metadata:manager|metadata manager]].


===== Default =====

If no featured image is found:
  * the featured image of the [[:docs:page:system:system|parent until the root]] is used if any
  * and if none is found, the [[:docs:app:logo|logo]] is used in last resort.
