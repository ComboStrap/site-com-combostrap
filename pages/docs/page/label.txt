====== The label ======



===== About =====
The ''label'' is a short description of a page. 

It's generally used in a [[:docs:lists:lists|listing]] such as a table cell.

Its length should be a couple of words while the [[:docs:page:description|description]] may flow on several lines.





===== How to set a label =====

By default, the value of the label is the [[:docs:page:title|title]].

You can overwrite it by setting a ''label'' property in the [[docs:metadata:manager|metadata manager]]

===== Template =====

You can use the ''%%$label%%'' [[docs:templating:variable|variable]] 

Example:
<webcode name="Default" frameborder="0">
<code dw>
The label of this page is: ''$label''
</code>
  * The result:
</webcode>
