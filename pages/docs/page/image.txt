====== Page Image ======


===== About =====
''image'' is a [[docs:metadata:metadata|page metadata]] that defines an illustrative [[docs:content:image|image]] for the page.



The image:
  * can be rendered with the [[docs:content:page-image|pageimage component]] in [[docs:templating:template|template]]
  * and will be added into [[docs:social:social|social]] cards such as [[docs:social:twitter|twitter]], [[docs:social:google|google]] or [[docs:social:facebook|facebook]].

The image should be relevant to the page. For example, if you define an image for a news article, the image must be relevant to that news article.






<note>
Because  [[docs:social:social|social image]] ([[docs:social:twitter#image|twitter]], [[docs:social:google#image|google]] and [[docs:social:facebook#image|facebook]]) have all differents image specifications, if the images found are not conform (low resolution, bad type), they are not used.
</note>
===== How to set page images ? =====

The recommended images are:
   * high-resolution (minimum of 300,000 pixels when multiplying ''width'' and ''height'', to avoid blurry, unclear images)
   * with the following aspect ratios: ''16x9'', ''4x3'', and ''1x1'' (to avoid [[docs:content:image#cropping|cropping]])

You can set the path of your image in the [[docs:metadata:manager|metadata manager]].

Note that you can't upload the images with the metadata manager for now, therefore:
  * you need to upload your image while editing first (note that the first image in your page is by default the page image).
  * or you can edit the [[docs:metadata:frontmatter|frontmatter]] directly.

**Frontmatter example:**
  * Single Image
<code json>
{
    "image": ":photos:1x1:photo.jpg"
}
</code>
  * Multiple:
<code json>
{
    "image": [
         ":photos:1x1:photo.jpg",
         ":photos:4x3:photo.jpg",
         ":photos:16x9:photo.jpg"
    ]
}
</code>

<note>
Moving image path with the [[support:plugin#move|move plugin]] will update their path.
