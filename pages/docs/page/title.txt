====== Page Title ======

===== About =====

''ComboStrap'' can manage the ''title'' of a web page also known as the page ''headline''.

A page's title may be a few words or a phrase whereas a [[description|page's description]] might be a sentence or two or even a short paragraph. 

In the [[https://developers.google.com/search/docs/beginner/seo-starter-guide#create-good-titles-and-snippets-in-search-results|Google SEO start guide title section]], Google recommends to create title that are:
  * ''Accurate'' (that describe the page's content)
  * ''Unique'' for each page
  * ''Brief'' but ''descriptive''


This ''title'' will:
  * show up in the [[docs:seo:serp|Search Engine Result Pages (SERP)]] (the results that you see when querying Google)
  * show up in the title bar at the top of the web browser, 
  * show up in [[docs:social:social|social]] cards such as [[..:social:twitter|twitter]], [[..:social:google|google]]  or [[..:social:facebook|facebook]]
  * be used when someone bookmarks the page.
  * be used in ''text-to-speech (TTS)'' (thanks to [[https://developers.google.com/search/docs/data-types/speakable|Speakable]])



===== How to set the title ? =====

With [[:start|ComboStrap]], if you set a ''title'' property with the [[docs:metadata:manager|metadata manager]], it will become the page title.

Example for this page with ''Page title (Set by Combostrap)''

===== Default  =====

By default, the title of a page is in order of precedence:
   * the [[docs:app:tagline|tagline]] if this is the [[docs:page:system:index#root|root home page]]
   * the [[docs:page:h1|the first heading]] if not empty
   * the [[docs:page:name|page name]]

<note>
The  [[docs:page:system:index|namespace name]] and the [[docs:app:name|app name]] are added to the web browser title.
