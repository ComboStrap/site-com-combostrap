====== Automatic Canonical Path ======


===== About =====
This feature provides a default value for the [[..:page:canonical|canonical path]] based on the last parts of the [[docs:page:path|page path]]

<note info>
There is no automatic canonical created for the [[docs:layout:page:slot|slots]] as they are not intended to be accessed directly.
</note>


===== Example =====
For example, if you have a [[docs:page:path|page path]] with the value
<file>
:seo:backlink
</file>
This feature will:
  * not create a [[..:page:canonical|canonical]] if the [[#configuration|minimal number of name configuration]] is 0
  * create a [[..:page:canonical|canonical]] of:
      * ''backlink'' if the [[#configuration|minimal number of name configuration]] is 1
      * ''seo:backlink'' if the [[#configuration|minimal number of name configuration]] is 2

===== Configuration =====
If the [[docs:configuration|configuration]] ''MinimalNamesCountForAutomaticCanonical'' has a value of:
  * ''0'' disable this feature
  * ''1'' will create a [[..:page:canonical|canonical]] with the first last name part
  * ''2'' will create a [[..:page:canonical|canonical]] with the last two name parts

<note tip>
  * For small website, this configuration is set to 1
  * For bigger website, this configuration is set to 2
To have a value above 2 is not really common and should be avoided.
