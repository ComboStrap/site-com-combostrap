====== ComboStrap Page Metadata - Canonical URL ======


===== About =====
A ''canonical'' is a short unique named identifier for a page.



===== Usage =====

The canonical:
  * is used to create a [[docs:url:permalink|named permalink]]
<code url>
https://yourdomain.com/your/canonical
</code>
  * should be used in your tracking metrics
  * can be used as [[docs:url:canonical_url|canonical url]]

===== Value =====


It should have meaning and be understandable by humans

The ''canonical'' value:
  * should be unique for all pages of your website (ie domain).
  * is a path
  * does not need to be the [[docs:metadata:path|page path]]
  * is always lowercase
===== Demo =====
This page has the canonical value set to ''canonical'' and therefore is also available at the Canonical URL. ''https://combostrap.com/canonical''


You can try it your self.

<btn>
[[https://combostrap.com/canonical#demo|Navigate to this page via its canonical URL !]]
</btn>

or

<btn>
[[docs:metadata:canonical#demo|Navigate to this page via its standard URL !]]
</btn>


===== How to set the canonical value ? =====

==== Manually ====

To set the canonical value, uses the [[manager|metadata manager]] and set the ''canonical'' property in a wiki path format (ie the path separator should be a colon)

Example:
<code dw>
my:path
</code>

==== Automatically ====

You can also create a canonical value based on the last parts of a [[path|page path]]. See [[automatic_canonical]]
