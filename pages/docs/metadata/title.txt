====== ComboStrap Page Metadata - Title ======

===== About =====

''ComboStrap'' can manage the meta ''title'' of a web page. It's also known as the page ''headline''.

A page's title may be a few words or a phrase (whereas a [[description|page's description]] might be a sentence or two or even a short paragraph. 

In the [[https://developers.google.com/search/docs/beginner/seo-starter-guide#create-good-titles-and-snippets-in-search-results|Google SEO start guide title section]], Google recommends to create title that are:
  * ''Accurate'' (that describe the page's content)
  * ''Unique'' for each page
  * ''Brief'' but ''descriptive''


This ''title'' will:
  * show up in the ''Search Engine Result Pages (SERP)'' (the results that you see when querying Google)
  * show up in the title bar at the top of the web browser, 
  * show up in [[docs:social:social|social]] cards such as [[..:social:twitter|twitter]], [[..:social:google|google]]  or [[..:social:facebook|facebook]]
  * be used when someone bookmarks the page.
  * be used in ''text-to-speech (TTS)'' (thanks to [[https://developers.google.com/search/docs/data-types/speakable|Speakable]])



===== Processing =====

==== Default  ====

By default, the title of a page is:
  * [[docs:metadata:h1|the first heading]]
  * and if empty, the [[docs:metadata:name|page name]]

<note>
The [[docs:app:name|app name]] is added to the title
</note>


==== How to set the title ? ====

With [[:start|ComboStrap]], if you set a ''title'' property with the [[docs:metadata:manager|metadata manager]], it will become the page title.

Example for this page with ''Page title (Set by Combostrap)''
