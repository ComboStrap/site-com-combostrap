====== ComboStrap Metadata - Page Path ======



===== About =====
The ''path'' is a [[..:metadata:metadata|page metadata]] that represents the full qualified path of a page in a wiki form (ie the path separator is a '':'' colon)

You can't set a path, the path is a protected metadata.

It can be seen in:
  * the [[docs:analytics:data|analtyics data file]].
  * the [[docs:metadata:manager|metadata manager]]

This metadata is known as [[doku>pagename]] for Dokuwiki.

By default, this is the value that is reported in third analytics tool such as [[support:plugin#google analytics|Google Analytics]] but you can use the [[docs:metadata:canonical#google analytics|canonical path]] instead.
===== Usage and Example =====

A path can be used as [[docs:templating:variable|variable]] in a [[docs:templating:template|template]] to create [[docs:content:link|links]]


Example:
<webcode name="Default" frameborder="0">
  * the [[docs:templating:template|template]]
<code dw>
<template>
The path of this page is ''$path'' and you can use it in a link: [[$path|link to this page]]
</template>
</code>
  * Output:
</webcode>
