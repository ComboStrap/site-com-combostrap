====== ComboStrap Page Metadata - Front Matter ======

===== About =====
''Front Matter'' is a component that permits to [[docs:admin:replication|replicate]] the [[..:metadata:metadata|metadata]] into your page.

This functionality is used when you want to:
  * move your pages and get the metadata in sync in other ComboStrap installation
  * get an history of the metadata modification
  * want to kept your short page id close to your page when using  [[docs:page:url#permanent|permant url]]

It borrows its name from the [[kb>markup:front-matter|front matter book]]

<note>
The frontmatter is the [[wp>Single_source_of_truth|source of truth]] for ComboStrap. Any value in the frontmatter will take precedence over the [[docs:metadata:viewer|raw metadata]] or [[docs:analytics:database|internal database]] metadata.

A frontmatter is a block located at the start of your page that:
  * starts with ''%%---json%%''
  * contains a json document representing your metadata
  * end with ''%%---%%''

Example:
<code javascript>
---json
{
    "name":"Short Name",
    "title":"My Big title in the Search Engine Result Pages",
    "description":"That's the article that you want to read!"
}
