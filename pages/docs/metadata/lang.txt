====== ComboStrap Page Metadata - Lang (Language) ======


===== About =====
The ''lang'' [[metadata|metadata]] is an language identifier that sets the language of a page


The format supported is the [[https://www.loc.gov/standards/iso639-2/php/English_list.php|ISO 639-2]] 2 letters code.

Example: 
  * ''en'' (English), 
  * ''fr'' (French)
  * ''nl'' (Dutch)
  * ''ar'' (Arabic). (See [[#rtlright_to_left_language|Right-to-left language support]])

The language identifier is used:
  * in the [[locale|locale]] to localize the page.
  * in the [[:strap|strap template]] to set the lang and direction




===== Demo =====
We have created a page in ''arabic'' that has a language direction from [[#rtlright_to_left_language|right-to-left (''rtl'')]]

See the demo page: [[lang_ar]]




===== Set =====
The default value is set in the [[#config:lang]] configuration.

You can set a ''lang'' code in the [[manager|manager]] for a specific page.


===== Configuration =====

==== config:lang ====

The default value is set in the [[doku>config:lang]] configuration.


==== RTL: Right to left language ====

As ''bootswatch'' does not support yet RTL languages, you need to set your [[docs:utility:bootstrap|Bootstrap version at minimal to 5 with the bootstrap theme]]. 

Example with the version ''5.01 - bootstrap'':
