====== ComboStrap URL - Page Alias ======


===== About =====
A ''page alias'' is an extra [[docs:metadata:path|path]] value for a page.

If a ''page'' has an alias that corresponds to the path of a [[docs:url:404|missing page]], a [[..:url:http_redirect|redirection]] is performed.

You can see them as symlink or shortcut for a file system.





===== Management =====

==== Creation ====

The page alias is automatically created when a page is [[support:plugin#move|moved with the move plugin]]

For instance:
  * you could have a page at the [[docs:metadata:path|]] ''fruit:pear''. 
  * if you move the page to another location such as ''fruit:tree:pear''
  * the page ''fruit:tree:pear'' will get the alias ''fruit:pear''




==== See ====

You can see the aliases for a page via the [[docs:metadata:manager|metadata manager]].

==== Query ====
You can [[docs:analytics:query|query]] the aliases with the following statement:

<code sql>
select 
  p.path, 
  pa.alias 
from 
   page_aliases pa,
   inner join pages p on pa.UUID = p.UUID
