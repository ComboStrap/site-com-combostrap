====== ComboStrap URL - Page Alias ======


===== About =====
A ''page alias'' is an extra [[docs:metadata:path|path]] value for a page.

If a ''page'' has an alias that corresponds to the path of a [[docs:url:404|missing page]], a [[..:url:redirection|redirection]] is performed.

You can see them as symlink or shortcut for a file system.




===== Type =====

==== Redirect ====
A ''redirect'' alias is an alias that will perform a [[docs:url:permanent|permanent redirection]].

This type of redirect are automatically created:
  * when a page was matched with the [[docs:url:bestendpagename|best end page name redirection algorithm]] (with at minimal two path parts that match by default)
  * or when you [[support:plugin#move|move a page with the move plugin]].

For instance:
  * if you have a page at the [[docs:metadata:path|path]] ''fruit:pear''. 
  * if you move the page to another location such as ''fruit:tree:pear''
  * the page ''fruit:tree:pear'' will get the alias ''fruit:pear'' with the type ''redirect''

==== Synonym ====

A ''synonym'' alias is an alias that will perform a [[docs:url:transparent|transparent redirection]].
The page will be served normally as if it was also existing to the synonym path.


===== Management  =====


You can create, delete and see the aliases for a page with the [[docs:metadata:manager|metadata manager]].


===== Database =====
You can [[docs:analytics:query|query]] the aliases with the following statements:
