====== ComboStrap Getting Started - Dokuwiki Installation ======

===== About =====
[[:combostrap|ComboStrap]] is based on the [[doku>|Dokuwiki Engine]]. 


===== Steps =====



==== DokuWiki Version Check ====
If you have already a Dokuwiki Installation, you should have the last version (actually ''2020-07-29 "Hogfather''). We support the previous version only a couple of month.

You can check the version of your installation:
  * by logging in as a superuser 
  * and use the ''do=check'' parameter to your wiki's URL. Eg:
<code>
http://yourdomain/yourwiki/doku.php?do=check
</code>

If you don't have the last version, we recommend to install the [[https://www.dokuwiki.org/plugin:upgrade|Upgrade plugin]] and to upgrade your installation.


==== Dokuwiki Installation ====

If you don't have a Dokuwiki Instance, you can install it as follow:
  * [[https://download.dokuwiki.org/|Download the last Dokuwiki]], 
  * Upload the zip file to your web server ([[support:requirement#php|php version supported]]: ''8.0'', ''7.3'', ''7.2'', ''7.1'')
  * Unzip it to your web directory
  * Access the installer script at ''https://yourdomain.com/install.php''
  * Answer the install form (Choose at minimal the [[doku>config:useacl|ACL option]], otherwise you get no access to the admin page)
  * Done

  * about the installation, see [[doku>install]]
  * about the installer script, see [[doku>installer]]
