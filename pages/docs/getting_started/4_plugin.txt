====== ComboStrap Getting Started - Third Plugins ======


===== About =====
[[:combostrap|ComboStrap]] uses and supports third utility plugins natively. 

We are using them daily and share them with you. You can install them the same way than [[docs:getting_started:2_combo|Combo]] and [[docs:getting_started:3_strap|Strap]]

This is an optional and informative step.

===== List =====

==== Move ====

The [[doku>plugin:move]] plugin permits to move page without creating any [[docs:quality:broken_link|broken link]].

ComboStrap intercepts the move event and moves the [[docs:content:link|link]] and [[docs:content:image|image]] accordingly.

You can quickly move a page with the ''rename'' action in the [[docs:layout:page:railbar|railbar]].

==== Search Index Manager ====

The ''search index'' is an index of your page that permits to retrieve quickly any information. 

The index is [[doku>search|updated]] incrementally page by page when a visitor see a page.

If you change a lot of page (for instance, making a release), the [[doku>plugin:searchindex|search index manager]] is for you. It will rebuild the index completely.

You access it on the admin page via the ''admin'' action of the [[docs:layout:page:railbar|railbar]]

==== Cache ====
If you have an inconsistent page, you may have a cache issue. The [[doku>plugin:stale]] permits to make the whole cache stale in one click.

You access it as action in the [[docs:layout:page:railbar|railbar]]

==== Analytics ====

If you want some analytics information on your page, you can use the following Google plugin:
  * [[doku>plugin:googleanalytics|Google Analtyics]]
  * [[doku>plugin:googletagmanager|Google Tag Manager]]

You can configure your tag id via the [[doku>plugin:config|configuration manager]] available via the ''admin'' action of the [[docs:layout:page:railbar|railbar]]
