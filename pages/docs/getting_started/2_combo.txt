  * Click on the ''Extension Manager'' link to go to the [[doku>plugin:extension|Extension Manager plugin]].
  * Click on the ''Search and Install'' link to go to the ''Search tab''

==== Install the SQLite extension ====

''combo'' is saving its data in a sqlite database and therefore uses this extension.

  * Search for the term ''sqlite''
  * Click on the ''install'' button.

==== Disable the already included extensions ====
<note warning>
If you have already one of this extension:
  * [[doku>plugin:404manager]]
  * [[doku>plugin:webcomponent]]
you need to disable them because they are already included in this installation.

</note>
Steps:
  * Search the extension in the ''extension manager''
  * And click the disable button (or uninstall)

<note tip>
The ''combo'' term was chosen for this reason. It's just a ''combo''
</note>

==== Do you have any other plugins ? ====

''ComboStrap'' is tested against [[docs:getting_started:4_plugin|third party plugins]] but we can't test them all.

This application has a large code base going from [[docs:utility:cache|cache]] to [[docs:url:url|url]] and [[docs:component|user interface]] management.

Plugins that are too old or does not respect the DokuWiki Interfaces may not work well with ''ComboStrap''.

If this is the case and that you got your installation not working anymore, the fix is on your server:
  * to rename the directory ''dokuwiki/lib/plugins/combo'' to ''dokuwiki/lib/plugins/combo.old'' 
  * or to delete it

And to [[:support|send us the log of your webserver]] if you want us to take a look.
==== Install the Combo extension ====

  * Search for the term ''Combo''
  * Click on the ''install'' button.
