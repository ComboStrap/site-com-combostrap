====== ComboStrap - Main Slot ======


===== About =====
In the [[page|page layout]], the ''page main slot'' is a [[docs:layout:page:slot|slot]]  where the content of your page is rendered. 



===== Main Header and Footer =====

The ''main slot'' supports also two sub-slots:
  * the ''main header slot'', located at the top of the main slot
  * and the ''main footer slot'', located at the bottom of the main slot

This slots are mostly used for templating.

For instance, you could add for each page:
  * the [[docs:navigation:hierarchical_breadcrumb|hierarchical breadcrumb]] in the ''main header''
  * a [[docs:router:permalink|permalink]] in the ''main footer''
  * or any other component.

The ''main header and footer slot'' are named respectively:
  * ''slot_main_header''
  * ''slot_main_footer''

If you create pages with this name:
  * at the root directory, all pages will include them
  * in a namespace (directory), only the subpages will get them
