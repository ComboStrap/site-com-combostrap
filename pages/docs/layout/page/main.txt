====== ComboStrap - Main Slot ======


===== About =====
In the [[page|page layout]], the ''page main slot'' is a [[docs:layout:page:slot|slot]]  where the content of your page is rendered. 



===== Main Header and Footer =====

The ''main slot'' supports also two sub-slots:
  * the [[main_header_slot|main header slot]], located at its top 
  * and the [[main_footer_slot|main footer slot]], located at its bottom 

This slots are mostly used for [[docs:templating:templating|templating]].

For instance, you could add for each page:
  * the [[docs:navigation:hierarchical_breadcrumb|hierarchical breadcrumb]] in the ''main header''
  * a [[docs:social:share|share button]] in the ''main footer''
  * or any other component.
