====== Strap Template - Slot ======


===== About =====
''slot'' are placeholders in the template that can be filled by creating a page with a special name.

The Strap template supports the following slot:
  * [[docs:layout:page:side_slot|side slot]] (at the left side of the content)
  * [[docs:layout:page:header_slot|header slot]] (at the top of a page)
  * [[docs:layout:page:footer_slot|footer slot]] (at the bottom of a page)
  * [[docs:layout:page:sidekick_slot|sidekick slot]] (at the right of the content)


For instance:
  * if you want to fill the [[docs:layout:page:side_slot|side slot]] for the whole website, you would create the ''side slot'' page (by default the ''sidebar'' page)
  * if you want to fill the [[docs:layout:page:side_slot|side slot]] only  for a specific ''namespace'', you would create the  ''side slot'' page under this namespace (for instance: ''namespace:sidebar'')

===== Features =====

  * A ''slot'' can be defined for every namespace (directory). If there is no ''slot'' page for a namespace, a  ''slot'' page is searched in the ascendant namespace (parent, grand parent,...)
  * A ''slot'' is automatically [[docs:quality:automatic_hidden|hidden]] and not searchable.
  * [[docs:cache:sideslots|Side slots (side and sidekick slots)]] are rendered for every namespace and regenerated for each namespace changes (page creation, modification, deletion)

==== Bar vs Slot ====

In ComboStrap, a ''slot'' is a place in the template where content can be added while a ''bar'' is a UI component such as the [[docs:menubar:menubar|menu bar]].
