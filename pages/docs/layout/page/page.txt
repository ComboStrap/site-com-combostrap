ComboStrap supports the following layouts

^ Layout ^ Description ^
| [[#holy]] | The holy-grail layout |
| [[#median]] | A layout that improves readability by constraining and centering the content |
| [[#landing]] | A layout to create a landing page for the [[:docs:app:home|home page]] |
| [[#index]] | A layout to create a semi-landing page for the [[:docs:type:index|index pages]] |
| [[#hamburger]] | The default layout of admin pages (without sides)|



===== List =====


==== Holy ====

The default layout is a fully responsive layout (known also as the ''holy grail'') with:
  * a [[docs:layout:page:header_slot|page header slot]]
  * a [[docs:layout:page:footer_slot|page footer slot]]
  * and three columns:
      * [[docs:layout:page:side_slot|left slot (page side)]]
      * [[release:deprecated:sidekick_slot|right slot (page sidekick)]]
      * [[main|main slot (ie content)]] (main header and footer slot)

They are all [[docs:layout:page:container|contained]] in a page that is:
  * centered 
  * with a width adjusted by screen size (by breakpoint)

The main content width expands to the width of the page if the page sides are not present.

==== Median ====

The median is a layout that emphasizes readability by:
  * centering the main content
  * with a fix width (making the length of a line shorter).

It's the default layout for all root pages (ie pages without [[:docs:page:namespace|namespace]])

The page side is not shown.







==== Landing ====

The landing layout is the default layout of the [[:docs:app:home|home page]].

In a landing page layout:
  * the main content is not [[docs:layout:page:container|contained]]
  * the page header, the page footer, the main content are shown
  * the page sides, the main sides, the main header and the main footer are not shown

To know more about landing page, see the dedicated page: [[landing]]


==== Hamburger ====

The hamburger is the default layout for any admin page.

A hamburger will show only three layers:
  * the page header
  * the main (header, content and footer)
  * the page footer

There is no page side.


==== Index ====

An ''index'' is a landing page for a [[:docs:page:namespace|Namespace]].

It shows:
  * the page header and footer
  * the main header and content
  * the page side

It does not show:
  * the [[:docs:navigation:toc|table of content]]
  * the page footer
  * the sidekick
