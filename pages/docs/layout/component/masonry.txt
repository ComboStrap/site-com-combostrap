====== ComboStrap UI - Masonry ======



===== About =====
''masonry'' is a layout component. Its children are laid out like a mason fitting stones in a wall (placing elements based on available vertical space).

This layout is handy when you want to lay out a list of components that does not have an uniform height (Ie to mix small and big card for instance).

A masonry layout is generally used with [[docs:block:card|cards]] or [[docs:block:blockquote|blockquotes]].

        <btn>[[:start|Go to this page !]]</btn>
    </card>


    <blockquote>
        Lorem ipsum [[:start|dolor]] sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Integer posuere erat a ante.

</masonry>
</code>
</webcode>


===== Support =====

==== Bootstrap 5 support ====

If you use [[release:archive:1.13_bootstrap5|Bootstrap version 5]], you may see that the output is slightly different than with Bootstrap version 4.

This is because [[release:archive:1.13_bootstrap5|Bootstrap version 5]] does not support ''card-column'' anymore and we have implemented it manually.
