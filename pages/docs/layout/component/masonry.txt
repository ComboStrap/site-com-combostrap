====== ComboStrap UI - Masonry ======



===== About =====
With the ''masonry'' components, you can put a [[docs:block:card|card]] or [[docs:block:blockquote|blockquote]] in a masonry layout.

The elements are laid out like a mason fitting stones in a wall (placing elements based on available vertical space).

        === Teaser Title  ===
        A example taken from [[https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.3/components/card/#example|the bootstrap quick example]] on how to build a card title in order to make up the bulk of the teaser content. 
        
        <btn>[[:start|Go to this page !]]</btn>
    </card>


    <blockquote>
        Lorem ipsum [[:start|dolor]] sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Integer posuere erat a ante.
        <cite>Someone famous in [[:start|Source Title]]</cite>
    </blockquote>

</masonry>
</code>
</webcode>


===== Support =====

==== Bootstrap 5 support ====

If you use [[release:archive:1.13_bootstrap5|Bootstrap version 5]], you may see that the output is slightly different than with Bootstrap version 4.

This is because [[release:archive:1.13_bootstrap5|Bootstrap version 5]] does not support ''card-column'' anymore and we have implemented it manually.
