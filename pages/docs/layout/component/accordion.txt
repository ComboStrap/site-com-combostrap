<accordion>
    <panel collapsed="false">
        <label>Collapsible Group Item #1</label>
        Some placeholder content for the first accordion card. This card is shown by default because of the ''collapsed'' attribute.
    </panel>
    <panel>
        <label><icon name="hamburger"/> Menu</label>
        === With Hamburger Icon ===
