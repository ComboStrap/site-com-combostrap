====== ComboStrap UI - Grid (Row and Cell) ======

{{backlinks>.}}

===== Syntax =====
<code dw>
<row type>
   <cell></cell>
   <cell></cell>
</row>
</code>
where:
  * ''type'' may be the value:

^ Type ^ Description ^ Default for ^
| ''auto'' | each cell width will automatically calculated to be greater than the minimum width of ''300'' | loss grid | 
| ''fit'' | each cell will takes their natural width . Note that for cells with text and without width, we set a width of ''300'' (because the natural width of text is the whole line until the end of the paragraph) | contained grid |
| ''none'' | the content will just shrink without overflow | |


<note>
You can use all [[styling:styling|styling attributes]].
</note>





===== Example =====

==== Basic two columns ====

The combostrap grid will layout nicely your cells uniformly on the horizontal. They are also readable from the start from a mobile device.

<webcode>
<code dw>
<row spacing="p-5">
    <cell background-color="green" color="white">
        First paragraph in the first cell.
        
        Second paragraph in the first cell.
    </cell>
    <cell background-color="blue" color="white" vertical="center">
        Second cell
     </cell>
</row>
</code>
  * Output:
</webcode>


<note tip>
As you can see, the dimension of the the cells are not uniform, this is why the [[styling:background|background]] is never used inside a grid.
</note>

==== Card with a media ====
You can also use the grid in a [[docs:block:card|card]] to create all sort of layout.

Example of a card:
  * with an [[docs:content:image|image]] on the left
  * completly [[styling:clickable|clickable]] 

<webcode name="Default" frameborder="0">
<code dw>
<card background-color="light" align="center" width="fit" >
    <row>
      <cell >
        {{ :styling:subway_card_tile.png?0x180 |}}
      </cell>
      <cell>
        === Card Clickable Grid ===
        This placeholder content is intended to mimic what some real-world content would look like, and we're using it here to give the component a bit of body and size.
    
        [[#custom_card|Custom card]]
      </cell>
    </row>
</card>
</code>

</webcode>
