====== ComboStrap Routing - Transparent Redirect ======


===== About =====
A ''transparent redirect'' is a [[redirection|redirection]] that shows the content of another page transparently (A visitor or a search engine bot will not see the redirection).

It happens when the requested URL matches:
  * the [[docs:page:url|page url (the canonical url)]]
  * a [[docs:router:alias#synonym|synonym alias]] of a page
  * a [[ban|banned path (bad behavior protection)]]


===== Demo =====

This page has a [[docs:router:alias#synonym|synonym]] of  '':redirection:transparent'' and is therefore accessible also from the below link.

Click on the below button to test a transparent redirect:

<webcode name="Default" frameborder="0">
<btn>
[[:redirection:transparent]]
</btn>
</webcode>








===== Message =====
A ''transparent redirect'' is silent and shows no message.
