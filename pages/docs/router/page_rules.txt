====== ComboStrap Routing - Pages Rules ======

===== About =====
''page rules'' are rules that permits to apply a [[docs:router:permanent|permanent redirection]] for a page or a group of page.


===== Example =====

{{docs:router:page_rules_illustration.png|}}
==== Redirect all pages from the namespace ''database'' to ''db'' ====
With the below rule:
  * Pattern: ''database:*''
  * Target: ''%%db:$1%%''
If a page called ''database:table'' does not exist, the router will calculate the target page ''db:table'' and if the page exists, it will [[transparent|rewrite it]].

==== Redirect a page to an external web site ====
With the below rule:
  * Pattern: ''dokuwiki:404managerplugin''
  * Target: ''https://combostrap.com/url/manager''
If a page called ''dokuwiki:404managerplugin'' does not exist, the router will send a [[permanent|permanent redirect]] to the page ''https://combostrap.com/url/manager''
===== Steps =====
==== Go to the new rule page ====

  * Go to the [[doku>admin_window|admin window]] (ie ''https://yourdomain.com/dokuwiki/?do=admin'')
  * Click the ''ComboStrap - Page Rules'' link
  * Click the button ''Add a new rule''

==== Create a rule ====

  * The matcher is a pattern that should match the missing Dokuwiki Id. You can use one or more ''*'' that match any number of characters (including none).
  * The target is the new page. The ''%%$1, $2, ...%%'' characters correspond to the value of the star character ''*'' in order and you can use them to define the target page
  * The priority defines in which order, the page rules are applied.
