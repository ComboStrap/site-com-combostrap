====== ComboStrap URL Management - Editor Redirection ======


===== About =====

With the ''edit mode'' [[redirection|redirection]], a writer (ie a user with the edit permission) is redirected directly to the editor.

If this redirection is disabled, an editor will see a minimal page indicating that the page does not exist.

<note tip>
A [[message|message]] can also be shown with the pages that have the same name.
