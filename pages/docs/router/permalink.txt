===== About =====
''permalink'' are short links that will be ''permanently'' accessible even if the page is [[docs:page:move|moved]]


===== How to create a permalink ? =====


==== Generated ====

A generated permalink is a link that uses the [[docs:page:page_id|page id]] as [[:docs:page:system:path|page path]]

As the id is guaranteed to never change, it's the real/true permalink.


<webcode name="Default" frameborder="0">
  * You can add a permalink to your page with the ''permalink'' component.
<code dw>
<permalink/>
</code>
  * Result: The generated permalink for this page is:
</webcode>

\\

A generated permalink performs a [[docs:router:permanent|permanent redirection]] to the [[docs:page:url|page url]]

==== Named ====

A named permalink is a link that uses the [[docs:page:canonical|canonical]] as [[:docs:page:system:path|page path]]

Note that a [[docs:page:canonical|canonical]] is not a true permalink as it may be modified (It should not, but you never know)


<webcode name="Default" frameborder="0">
  * You can add a named permalink in your page with the ''permalink'' component:
<code dw>
<permalink named strict="false"/>
</code>
  * The named permalink for this page is:
</webcode>


\\
\\

A named permalink performs a [[docs:router:permanent|permanent redirection]] to the [[docs:page:url|page url]].

<note tip>
  * By adding ''strict=false'', no link is shown and no error is reported if a canonical is not present.
  * For the named permalink, you can set a default canonical value with the [[docs:page:canonical_automatic|autocanonical feature]]. It allows using this feature without setting the [[docs:page:canonical|canonical value]] for each page.
