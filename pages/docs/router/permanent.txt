They are executed when:
  * when the [[docs:router:alias#redirect|alias type is redirect]].
  * when the requested url is a [[docs:router:permalink#generated|generated permalink]].
  * if the [[page_rules|page rules redirection]] leads to an existing page.

  * not save the redirected page into its search index.
  * and to delete it eventually 

In Web term, we perform a ''301'' redirection.
