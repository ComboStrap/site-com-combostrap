====== ComboStrap Routing - Best End Page Name Algorithm ======

===== About =====
The ''Best End Page Name'' is a [[action|redirection scoring algorithm]] that finds the best page to redirect to when a [[404|non-existing page]] is requested.

This algorithm performs the scoring by looping through the different part of a page name from the end to the beginning. For instance, if the page name was ''name1:name2:name3'', the algorithm would check first ''name3'', then ''name2'', then ''name1''

This concept comes from the fact that a content has a natural  hierarchical structure. If you have created a page called ''bird:sparrow'':
  * there is a lot of chance that a page with the same last name (ie ''sparrow'') would be the good one
  * there is also even more chance if this page was in the same category ''bird''
  * and so on.


===== Algorithm =====
When a user request a [[404|missing page]] (ie ''species:bird:sparrow''), the algorithm would:
  * search all pages with the same last name.
  * if there is no pages, returns and let the next [[action|redirection action]] takes place.
  * if it found pages. For instance, this two pages:
      * ''animal:bird:sparrow''
      * ''europe:sparrow''
  * it will score them by giving 1 point recursively for each matching name processing from the end to the beginning. For instance:
      * ''2'' point for ''animal:bird:sparrow'' (1 point for ''sparrow'' and 1 point for ''bird'')
      * ''1'' point for ''europe:sparrow''
  * it will then select the page with the highest score.
  * if the page has a score that is higher or equal to the [[#configuration|BestEndPageMinimalScoreForAlias configuration]]:
      * a [[docs:router:alias|alias redirect]] is created and a [[permanent|permanent redirect]] is performed.
      * otherwise an [[notfound|not found redirect]] is executed

===== Configuration =====

==== BestEndPageMinimalScoreForAliasCreation ====

This [[docs:app:configuration|configuration]] permits to:
  * create a [[docs:router:alias#redirect|alias redirect]]
  * and executes a [[permanent|permanent redirect]]
when the number of parts in the found path that matches the missing page is higher or equal.

By default, this value is 2 but you can disable it by setting a value of 0.




==== Action Order ====
You can set the importance of this rule in the [[action#configuration|redirection action configuration]].
