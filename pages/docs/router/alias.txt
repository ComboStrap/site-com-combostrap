====== ComboStrap URL - Page Alias ======


===== About =====
A ''page alias'' is an extra [[docs:page:system:path|path]] value for a page.

If a ''page'' has an alias that corresponds to the path of a [[docs:router:404|missing page]], a [[redirection|redirection]] is performed.

You can see them as symlink or shortcut for a file system.





<note warning>
With the [[:docs:page:url#permanent|permanent page url]], this feature is in a deprecation state.

Why? 

Because when moving heavily the files, you end up with a lot of aliases and it becomes really difficult to manage them.
The introduction of the [[:docs:page:url#permanent|permanent page url]] permits moving the file easily from location 
without this burden because it's identified by the unique [[:docs:page:page_id|page id]]

</note>

===== Type =====

==== Redirect ====
A ''redirect'' alias is an alias that will perform a [[docs:router:permanent|permanent redirection]].

This type of redirect are automatically created:
  * when a page was matched with the [[docs:router:bestendpagename|best end page name redirection algorithm]] (with at minimal two path parts that match by default)
  * or when you [[docs:page:move|move a page]].

For instance:
  * if you have a page at the [[docs:page:system:path|path]] ''fruit:pear''. 
  * if you move the page to another location such as ''fruit:tree:pear''
  * the page ''fruit:tree:pear'' will get the alias ''fruit:pear'' with the type ''redirect''



==== Synonym ====

A ''synonym'' alias is an alias that will perform a [[docs:router:transparent|transparent redirection]].
The page will be served normally as if it was also existing to the synonym path.


===== Management  =====


You can create, delete and see the aliases for a page with the [[docs:metadata:manager|metadata manager]].


===== Database =====
You can [[docs:analytics:query|query]] the aliases with the following statements:


<tabs enclosed-tabs>
<panel selected>
<label>Simple</label>
<code sql>
select * from page_aliases_vw;
</code>
</panel>
<panel>
<label>Advanced</label>
<code sql>
select
  p.path as page_path,
  pa.path as alias_path,
  pa.type as alias_type
from

   inner join pages p on pa.UUID = p.UUID;
</code>
