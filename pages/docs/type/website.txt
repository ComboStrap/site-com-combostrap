====== ComboStrap Metadata - Website (Home Page) ======


===== About =====
''WebSite'' is a [[type|page type]] that shows information to [[docs:seo:seo|search engine]] over the whole website.

Generally, you would have only one page of this type and it would be your [[docs:type:home#website|website home page]].


<note>''ComboStrap'' sets automatically a ''website'' [[type|type]] page on the [[docs:type:home#website|website home page]] if not set.</note>


The exact definition of a ''website'' from [[https://schema.org/WebSite|semantic.org]] is a set of related web pages that are served from a single web domain.



===== Metadata =====
The following metadata are automatically added to a ''website'' page:
  * ''url'', the base url
  * ''name'', the [[docs:app:name|website name]]
  * ''description'', the [[docs:app:tagline|tagline]]
  * ''image'', the [[docs:app:logo|logo]] (as png)


<note>
You can set more metadata yourself:
  * check the ''json-ld'' example and what kind of properties may be added at [[https://schema.org/WebSite|Schema.org WebSite]]
  * and go to the [[docs:social:google|Google Rich Result page]] to know how.
</note>

===== Internal Search Engine =====

We add also the [[docs:app:search|internal search engine]] that implements the [[https://developers.google.com/search/docs/data-types/sitelinks-searchbox|links searchbox]] in [[docs:social:google|google rich result]].
