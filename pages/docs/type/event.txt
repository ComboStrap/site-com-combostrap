===== About =====
An ''event page'' is a page that is advertising an event.

To tag your page has a ''event'', you need to have:
  * the [[type|type of page]] set to ''event''
  * a ''date_start'' set to the ''start'' [[docs:metadata:date_format|date]] of the event in the local timezone
  * a ''date_end'' set to the ''end'' [[docs:metadata:date_format|date]] of the event
  * [[docs:page:name|name]] - the name of the event
  * [[docs:page:description|a description]] - the description of the event



===== How to generate a list of event pages? =====

From the event dates, you can generate a list of event pages. See this howto: [[:howto:iterator-list-event|iterator list event]]

===== Location =====
We declare the page as [[https://developers.google.com/search/docs/advanced/structured-data/event|event page for google]] but to be valid, you also need to add the location in the [[docs:metadata:frontmatter|frontmatter]].

You can add a virtual or physical location by adding a "json-ld" property. Below is an example of an event taking place ''online'' and ''offline'' (if this is not the case for you, just delete the non-relevant location)
<code json>
{
  "json-ld": {
    "location": [
      {
        "@type": "VirtualLocation",
        "url": "https://domain/online/location"
      },
      {
        "@type": "Place",
        "name": "Physical Location - Snickerpark Stadium",
        "address": {
          "@type": "PostalAddress",
          "streetAddress": "100 West Snickerpark Dr",
          "addressLocality": "Snickertown",
          "postalCode": "19019",
          "addressRegion": "PA",
          "addressCountry": "US"
        }
      }
    ]
  }
}
</code>

===== Offers, performer, organizer =====

If you want to add more information such as ''offers'', ''performer'' or ''organizer'', you just need to add the properties defined in the [[https://developers.google.com/search/docs/advanced/structured-data/event|event page of google]] to the ''json-ld'' property.
