===== About =====
An ''index'' page is the page shown when a [[docs:page:namespace|namespace]] is asked in the [[docs:page:url|URL]] or [[docs:content:link|link]] path.

===== Example =====

A URL asking a namespace will look like that (ie with a backslash ''/'' at the end)
<code url>
https://foo.com/bar/
</code>

If this URL is entered in the Browser, then:
  * If there is a page with the  [[#startpage|startpage configuration]] name (default to start), the page shown will be
<code url>
https://foo.com/bar/start
</code>
  * If there is not a ''start'' page but there is a page with the name of the namespace (ie ''bar''), the page shown will be
<code url>
https://foo.com/bar/bar
</code>


===== Sql Templating =====
In a [[docs:templating:sql|Page Sql]], you can select all home pages with the attribute ''is_index''

Example:
<code sql>
select where is_index = 1 order by path desc limit 4
</code>

On this website, this SQL will select the following pages.
<iterator>
    <data>select where is_index = 1 order by path asc limit 4</data>
^ Path ^
<template>
| [[$path|$path]] |
</template>
</iterator>

===== WebSite =====
The website home page is a special index page that has its own documentation : [[docs:app:home]]



===== Configuration =====

==== startpage ====
The dokuwiki configuration [[doku>config:startpage]] permits to set the name of the home page. By default, this is ''start'' but other known name are ''index'' or ''home''
