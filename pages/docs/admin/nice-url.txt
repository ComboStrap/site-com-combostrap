====== Page - Nice URL ======



<note>
This is an informative page about nice URL
</note>

===== What is a nice URL ? =====

Dokuwiki uses as main entry the script ''doku.php'' and by default every [[..:page:url|page URL]] looks like that

https://combostrap.com/doku.php?id=url:nice

This URL has technical information (ie the name of the script ''doku.php'') that can be stripped off to let only the semantic information. A ''nice url'' would be

https://combostrap.com/url/nice

===== How to get nice URL =====
Dokuwiki has an article about this topic: More see [[doku>rewrite]]

<note>
''ComboStrap'' can't  rewrite the URL to use the script ''doku.php''


but it can [[docs:router:transparent|show page at different paths]].

**Example:** because this page has the ''nice:url'' [[docs:page:canonical|canonical value]], the page is also available at:

https://combostrap.com/nice/url


</note>


===== Important Configuration =====


The Dokuwiki Configuration that are important to get nice URL are the following one:
  * [[doku>config:userewrite]] - ''.htaccess'' (for nice URL)
  * [[doku>config:useslash]] - Yes (for nice URL)
