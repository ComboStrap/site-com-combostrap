====== Page - Nice URL ======



<note>
This is an informative page about nice URL
</note>

===== What is a nice URL ? =====

Dokuwiki uses as main entry the script ''doku.php'' and by default every [[..:page:url|page URL]] looks like that

https://combostrap.com/doku.php?id=url:nice

This URL has technical information (ie the name of the script ''doku.php'') that can be stripped off to let only the semantic information. A ''nice url'' would be

https://combostrap.com/url/nice

===== How to get Nice URL? =====

You should select the ''htaccess'' [[doku>rewrite|rewrite Dokuwiki]] option.

''htaccess'' is a misleading option name as it just means that the web server is configured to do the rewrite. We personally use Nginx.


===== What Combostrap can do with URL? =====

''ComboStrap'' can't  rewrite the URL to use the script ''doku.php'' as it depends on it.

But Combostrap can [[docs:router:transparent|show page at different URL]] 

**Example:** because this page has the ''nice:url'' [[docs:page:canonical|canonical value]], the page is also available at: https://combostrap.com/nice/url




===== Important Configuration =====


The Dokuwiki Configuration that are important to get nice URL are the following one:
  * [[doku>config:userewrite]] - ''.htaccess'' (for nice URL)
  * [[doku>config:useslash]] - Yes (for nice URL)
