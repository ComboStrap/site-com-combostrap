======  Replication ======


===== About =====
Combostrap replicates data from pages:
  * into the [[docs:analytics:replication|database]] for different functionality such as:
      * index 
      * [[docs:router:router|Routing]]
      * [[docs:templating:sql|Page sql]]
  * into the [[docs:metadata:frontmatter|frontmatter (if enabled)]]


The replication process is by default done on a page by page basis but you can start the replication for all pages with the [[cli|cli]] in case of administrative task such as a migration. For more information on the replication, see the dedicated replication page:
  * [[docs:analytics:replication]]
  * [[docs:metadata:frontmatter]]
