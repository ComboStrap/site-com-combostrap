====== ComboStrap Page Metadata - H1 title ======


===== About =====
''h1'' is the text of the first header. It's a shorter page name than the [[title|title]].

For instance, the ''h1'' for this page is ''ComboStrap Semantic - H1 title''.



===== Usage =====

''ComboStrap'' captures it and adds it to the [[semantic|metadata]] and you can then use it in a [[docs:utility:template|template component]] such as in the [[docs:navigation:page-explorer|page-explorer]].
