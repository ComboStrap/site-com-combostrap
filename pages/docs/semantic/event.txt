===== About =====
An ''event page'' is a page that is advertising an event.

To tag your page has a ''event'', you need to have:
  * the [[docs:semantic:type|type of page]] set to ''event''
  * a ''date_start'' set to the ''start'' [[date|date]] of the event
  * a ''date_end'' set to the ''end'' [[date|date]] of the event

You may also want to add:
  * [[docs:semantic:name|a name]] - for navigation
  * [[docs:semantic:name|a title]] - for the search engine and the [[docs:content:link|link title]]
  * [[docs:semantic:description|a description]] - for the search engine
