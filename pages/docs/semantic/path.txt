====== ComboStrap Metadata - Page Path ======



===== About =====
The ''path'' is a [[..:metadata:metadata|page metadata]] that represents the full qualified path of a page that can be used in [[docs:templating:template|template]] to create for instance [[docs:content:link|links]]

You can't set a path, the path is a derived metadata.

It can be seen in:
  * the [[docs:analytics:data|analtyics data file]].
  * the [[docs:semantic:viewer|metadata manager]]

This metadata is known as [[doku>pagename]] for Dokuwiki.
