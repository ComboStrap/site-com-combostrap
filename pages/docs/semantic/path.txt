====== ComboStrap Metadata - Page Path ======



===== About =====
The ''path'' is a [[semantic|page metadata]] that represents the full qualified path of a page that can be used in [[docs:utility:template|template]] to create for instance [[docs:content:link|links]]

You can't set a path, the path is a derived metadata and can be seen in the [[docs:analytics:data|analtyics data file]].
