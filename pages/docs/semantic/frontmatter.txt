====== ComboStrap Page Metadata - Front Matter ======

===== About =====
''Front Matter'' is a component that:
  * permits to add and set [[semantic|metadata]]
  * that will be published in your HTML page for:
      * a better [[docs:seo:seo|SEO]] such as:
          * [[title|title]]
          * [[description|description]]
          * [[canonical|canonical]]
      * a better [[docs:social:social|social experience]]
          * [[docs:social:twitter|Twitter]]
          * [[docs:social:facebook|Facebook]]
          * [[docs:social:google|Google]]
  * or can used in [[docs:utility:template|template]]

It borrows its name from the [[kb>markup:front-matter|front matter book]]

Just add a block of code that:
  * starts with ''%%---json%%''
  * contains a json document
  * end with ''%%---%%''

Example:
<code javascript>

===== Metadata =====

There is three groups of metadata:
  * [[#managed]]: the properties that ComboStrap used for its own processing
  * [[#protected]]: the properties that cannot be modified
  * ''unknown'': Unknown properties are written in the [[semantic|metadata]] without any further processing.

  * [[canonical|canonical]]
  * [[docs:semantic:name|page name]]
  * [[title|page title]]
  * [[h1|h1]]
  * [[description|description]]
  * [[docs:semantic:published|date_published]]
  * [[docs:semantic:image|image]]

  * [[docs:semantic:path|path]]
  * ''date_created'', ''date_modified''
  * ''user'', ''creator'', ''contributor''
