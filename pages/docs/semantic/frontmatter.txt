====== ComboStrap Page Metadata - Front Matter ======

===== About =====
''Front Matter'' is a component that:
  * permits to add and set [[semantic|metadata]]
  * that will be published in your HTML page for:
      * a better [[docs:seo|SEO]] such as:
          * [[title|title]]
          * [[description|description]]
          * [[canonical|canonical]]
      * a better social experience
          * Twitter (todo)
          * Facebook (only canonical for now)

It borrows its name from the [[kb>markup:front-matter|front matter book]]





===== Example =====
Just add a block of code that:
  * starts with ''%%---json%%''
  * contains a json document
  * end with ''%%---%%''

Example:
<code javascript>
---json
{
    "canonical":"my:id",
    "title":"My Big title in the Search Engine Result Pages",
    "description":"That's the article that you want to read!"
}
---
</code>

===== Properties =====

This section lists the properties that are active and that have a semantic.

There is two groups of metadata:
  * [[#combostrap]]: the properties that we are managing
  * [[#dokuwiki|dokuwiki]]: the properties that ''DokuWiki'' follows.

Unknown properties are written in the [[semantic|metadata]] without any further processing.

==== ComboStrap ====

''ComboStrap'' takes into account the below properties
  * [[canonical|canonical]]
  * [[title|title]]
  * [[description|description]]



==== Dokuwiki ====


Dokuwiki follows the [[http://dublincore.org/documents/dces/|Dublin Core element names]] as keys in their meta. See [[doku>metadata]]

If you use one of the key below, you can overwrite/set up this metadata.

The below table comes from [[doku>plugin:meta#data_structure|the documentation of the meta plugin]].
