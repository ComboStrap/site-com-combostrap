====== ComboStrap - SEO ======

{{:docs:seo:undraw_growth_chart_r99m.svg?0x250|}}


===== About =====
[[kb>seo|Search engine optimization (or SEO)]] is the process of making your website optimized for [[kb>search/engine|search engine]] such as as Google or Bing.

On a website level, it means:
  * [[#quality|Good quality content]]
  * [[#page metadata|Good semantic (page metadata / web structure)]]
  * [[#performance|Good page speed]]
  * [[#discoverability|Discoverability]]





===== SEO Subject =====

==== Page Metadata ====
The following data are used heavily by Search Engine and may be set specifically for a page:
  * [[docs:page:url|Canonical Url]]
  * [[docs:page:title|Title]]
  * [[docs:page:description|Description]]

==== Performance ====

There is so much to say that we have created a [[docs:performance:performance|dedicated page]].
==== Quality ====
[[docs:quality:low_quality_page|Low quality pages]] have a big impact on the SEO score. The [[docs:quality:quality|quality module]] aims to [[docs:quality:score|score]], [[docs:quality:dynamic_monitoring|monitor]] and [[docs:seo:lqpp|protect]] the quality of your website.

==== Discoverability ====

''discoverability'' is the science to be easily discoverable and understood by [[kb>search:engine|search engine]].

By default, you need to enable it or change the following configurations.
  * The [[docs:seo:sitemap|sitemap]] is a important element and should be enabled.
  * the [[doku>config:indexdelay|indexdelay]] delayed the indexation of modified pages by the search engine. To disable this anti-spam feature for an open wiki, you need to set it to ''0''

==== Social ====
The Combostrap page renders automatically as card in:
  * [[docs:social:twitter|Twitter]]
  * [[docs:social:facebook|Facebook]]
  * [[docs:social:google|Google]]

==== Web Core Vital ====

The web core vitals are the most critical SEO metrics.

You have:
  * ''Largest Contentful Paint'': that measures the time needed to paint what the user will see
  * ''First Input Delay'': that measures the time when a user can interact with your page (after the execution of all scripts)
  * ''Content Layout Shift'': that measures how the visual element shifts around.

We got feedback that the ''Content Layout Shift'' was not satisyfing. After investigation,
it boils down to the fact that javascript of third plugins may alter the page visual even if they are
not needed for the page.

If you want to increase your ''Content Layout Shift'' score, you can
[[docs:performance:frontend_optimization|disable the javascript for public user]] (ie for the search engine).


==== XHTML compliant ====

All the HTML page generated follows the internet standard and are generated to be easily crawlable and indexed by any search engine.
