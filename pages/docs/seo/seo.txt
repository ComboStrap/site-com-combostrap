{{:docs:seo:undraw_growth_chart_r99m.svg?0x250|}}


===== About =====
[[kb>seo|Search engine optimization (or SEO)]] is the process of making your website optimized for [[kb>search/engine|search engine]] (Google, Bing, ...) to get to the top of their result.




On a website level, it means:
  * [[#quality|Good quality content]]
  * [[#illustration|Good illustration]]
  * [[#page metadata|Good semantic (page metadata / web structure)]]
  * [[#performance|Good page speed]]
  * [[#discoverability|Discoverability]]

===== SEO Subject =====

==== Page Metadata ====


{{:docs:seo:search-result-page-with-metadata-explained.png|}}

The following data are used heavily by Search Engine in their algorithm. They are set by default and can be changed to meet your needs:
  * [[docs:page:url|Canonical Url]]
  * [[docs:page:title|Title]]
  * [[docs:page:description|Description]]
  * [[:docs:app:logo|Application Logo]]
  * [[:docs:app:name|Application Name]]

==== Illustration ====

Image illustrations are attention catchers for your readers, search engines, and social media.

That's why all pages get:
  * an illustrative image that is relevant to their content 
  * a social image for [[:docs:social:twitter|twitter]], [[:docs:social:facebook|facebook]] and other social network.

''ComboStrap'' does not let a page without any illustrative image. If a [[:docs:page:featured-image|featured image]] or [[:docs:page:featured-icon|featured icon]] is not set, it will use the [[:docs:page:first-image|the first image]] or an ancestor image.

Thanks to the [[:docs:content:page-image|page image component]], you can choose the image that you want to use:
  * as ''hero'' image in your [[:docs:theme:element:main-header|content header]]
  * or as ''page image'' in a [[:docs:layout:component:carrousel|carrousel]] or any [[:docs:templating:iterator|iterator component]]


==== Readibility ====

We make sure that there is enough contrast ratio for [[:docs:styling:color|color]] in the text.

It's used in:
  * The [[:docs:styling:text-color|text-color attribute]]
  * The [[:docs:theme:branding-colors|branding colors]]
  * The [[:docs:content:icon|icon]]

==== Performance ====

There is so much to say that we have created a [[docs:performance:performance|dedicated page]].
==== Quality ====
[[docs:quality:low_quality_page|Low quality pages]] have a big impact on the SEO score. The [[docs:quality:quality|quality module]] aims to [[docs:quality:score|score]], [[docs:quality:dynamic_monitoring|monitor]] and [[docs:seo:lqpp|protect]] the quality of your website.

==== Discoverability ====

''discoverability'' is the science to be easily discoverable and understood by [[kb>search:engine|search engine]].

By default, you need to enable it or change the following configurations.
  * The [[docs:seo:sitemap|sitemap]] is a important element and should be enabled.
  * the [[doku>config:indexdelay|indexdelay]] delayed the indexation of modified pages by the search engine. To disable this anti-spam feature for an open wiki, you need to set it to ''0''

==== Social ====
The Combostrap page renders automatically as card in:
  * [[docs:social:twitter|Twitter]]
  * [[docs:social:facebook|Facebook]]
  * [[docs:social:google|Google]]
  * and any open graph network such as [[docs:social:telegram|telegram]], signal, ...


==== Indexing Warnings ====

To reduce indexing warnings by the search engine, we disable actions when the [[:docs:theme:element:railbar#privaterailbar|railbar is private]].


For instance, the search engine would index the [[doku>media_manager|media manager]] and returns a bunch of ''Excluded By No Index Tag''.

{{:docs:theme:element:excluded_by_noindex_tag_google_console.jpg?400|}}
==== Web Core Vital ====

The web core vitals are the most critical SEO metrics.

You have:
  * ''Largest Contentful Paint'': that measures the time needed to paint what the user will see
  * ''First Input Delay'': that measures the time when a user can interact with your page (after the execution of all scripts)
  * ''Content Layout Shift'': that measures how the visual element shifts around.

We got feedback that the ''Content Layout Shift'' was not satisyfing. After investigation,
it boils down to the fact that javascript of third plugins may alter the page visual even if they are
not needed for the page.

If you want to increase your ''Content Layout Shift'' score, you can
[[howto:frontend_optimization|disable the javascript for public user]] (ie for the search engine).


==== XHTML compliant ====

All the HTML page generated follows the internet standard and are generated to be easily crawlable and indexed by any search engine.
