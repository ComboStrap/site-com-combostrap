====== ComboStrap SEO - Low Quality Page Protection (LQPP) ======


===== About =====
If your website has a lot of [[docs:quality:low_quality_page|low quality page]]:
  * your [[docs:seo:seo|SEO]] score will be lower
  * you can even get at worse the [[#Thin content with little or no added value]] penalty and be deleted from the search engine index.


This feature if [[#enable|enabled]] makes [[docs:quality:low_quality_page|low quality pages]] no more discoverable by [[kb>search:engine|Search Engine]] and prevents you to be banned by them.


===== Thin content with little or no added value =====
The ''Thin content with little or no added value'' is explained in the [[https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/9044175#thin-content|webmaster documentation]]

If you are going to the [[kb>google:search:console|Google Search Console]], you would see the following alert.

<note warning>
This site appears to contain a significant percentage of low-quality or shallow pages that do not provide users with much added value (such as thin affiliate pages, cookie-cutter sites, doorway pages, automatically generated content or copied content).
</note>

The effect is that:
  * Your website is deleted from the [[kb>search:engine|Search Engine Index]]
  * Your website will then be no more discoverable
  * and your visits will plunge.

===== Demo =====

We have created a low page demo to show you the protection in action.
  * Link: This is a  [[..:quality:low_quality_example|internal link to the low quality page]]. It is a [[#link type|warning link]] that is not  [[docs:styling:underline|underlined]] and if you are hovering over it, it will shows a tooltip. 
  * Mode: The [[#protection mode|protection mode]] of this website is ''hidden'' which means that everybody with an external link can still navigate to this page. For instance, if you click on this external link [[https://combostrap.com/quality/low_quality_example|low quality demo page]], you will be able to see the ''hidden'' low quality page.

===== Configuration =====
==== Enable ====
This protection is disabled by default. If you want to enable it, you need to check the ''lowQualityPageProtectionEnable'' checkbox [[:configuration|configuration]].


<note>
A protection becomes active for a page when [[docs:analytics:process|it was analyzed]].
</note>
==== Protection Mode ====
The ''lowQualityProtectionMode'' configuration holds a [[..:quality:protection|protection mode]] value that determines how a [[..:quality:low_quality_page|low quality page]] is protected.


==== Link Type ====
When the [[docs:quality:protection|protection mode value]] is ''robot'' or ''feed'', you can choose the tip of link created for [[docs:quality:low_quality_page|low quality pages]].


The possible values are:
^ Values ^  <itext><tooltip>Can we click on the link and navigate to the page</tooltip>Clickable</itext>  ^ <itext><tooltip>The visibility level defines the emphasis for the reader. The bigger, the more chance, your reader will notice the low quality page</tooltip>Visibility Level</itext> ^ Description ^
| ''normal'' |  <icon name="check"/>  | Editor | A ''normal'' link (default) shows less emphasis (not underlined) and add the ''LQPP'' suffix (''Low Quality Page Protection'') on the default title link tooltip making it visible for the editor. |
| ''warning'' |  <icon name="check"/>  | Reader | A ''warning'' link shows a [[docs:content:tooltip|tooltip]] with a warning making it more visible to the reader |
| ''login'' |  <icon name="close"/>  | Reader | A ''login'' link shows a [[docs:content:tooltip|tooltip]] requiring the user to [[docs:app:identity|login]] to make the link clickable. If the user is signed in, this is a normal link. |
