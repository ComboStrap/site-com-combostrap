====== ComboStrap SEO - Sitemap ======

===== About =====
A ''sitemap'' is a file that [[kb>search:engine|search engine]] will read in order to get a list of all your pages and add them to their index.

''Dokuwiki'' comes with a [[kb>sitemap|sitemap]] component that pings automatically search engines but you still need to [[#configuration|configure it]].

The following pages are not included in the ''sitemap'':
  * [[docs:quality:hidden|hidden pages]]
  * private pages
===== Articles Related =====
{{backlinks>.}}



===== Link =====

The ''sitemap'' file is available:
  * via URL at [[http://combostrap.com/doku.php?do=sitemap]]
  * or locally ''dokuwiki/data/cache/sitemap.xml.gz''

===== Configuration =====

==== Enable ====

To enable the ''sitemap'' generation, you need to set the [[doku>config:sitemap]] configuration with a number that defines a period in day that is not zero.
