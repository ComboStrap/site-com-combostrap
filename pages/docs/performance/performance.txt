====== ComboStrap - Perfomance ======

===== About =====
''performance'' is how fast your page will be perceived by your user from the moment they click on a link until they see the resulting page.


Google has a more detailed definition of what performance is and gives you a performance score along with performance metrics via the [[https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse|lighthouse product]].

Below is a run of the home page of this website with the [[https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/insights/|lighthouse website version]]. Note that our web server is running on a small machine with only 2 cores from Canada.

===== Steps =====

==== Stylesheet ====

=== Critical Path ===

All [[:howto:stylesheet-bootstrap|published stylesheet (bootstrap and bootswatch)]] are served by default from a [[docs:performance:cdn|CDN]]

If you are using only ComboStrap, you can even disable the DokuWiki Stylesheet for a public user with the [[docs:performance:frontend_optimization#disableDokuwikiStylesheet|disableDokuwikiStylesheet configuration]]

The size of a web page served to the public (user not logged in) can be optimized with the [[docs:performance:frontend_optimization|CSS optimization module]].

=== Stylesheet Preload ===
We preload stylesheet that are non critical for rendering. For instance, the stylesheet used for [[docs:animation:animation|animation]] are preloaded and added to the page at the end.
==== Javascript ====
All Javascript file are served from a [[docs:performance:cdn|CDN]] and are deferred (loaded at the end) because they are not needed for the first rendering.


If you only depend on the ''ComboStrap'' plugins, you can even [[docs:performance:frontend_optimization#javascriptdisable_backend|disable the backend javascript for public pages]].




==== Cache ====
Caching is done by default for all content based process (from page to image). 

For more information, see the page: [[..:cache:cache]]

==== Image ====

We follow the [[https://developers.google.com/search/docs/advanced/guidelines/google-images|Google best practices on image]]
=== Lazy load ===

All [[docs:content:image|images]] are [[docs:performance:lazy|lazy loaded]] if possible.

Lazy loaded means that they are loaded only when:
  * they are on the screen
  * they are going to enter on the screen.

=== Above the fold images ===

We don't lazy load images in the [[:docs:theme:slot:main_header_slot|main header]] because they are directly visible to the user. 
The user does not need to scroll to see them. The official term is ''Above-the-fold'' image.

If these images are lazily loaded, they delay the ''largest contentful paint'' performance metrics.

If you put ''Above-the-fold'' image, the writer should set the [[:docs:performance:lazy|lazy attribute]] to ''none''.



=== Automatic Responsive Sizing ===

All raster images (jpg, png, ...) are also automatically loaded with the appropriate sizing.

If a page contains an big image (say 2400px), this image will be resized and served to 300px on a small mobile screen.

If you want to see it in action, you can check the [[docs:content:raster#automatic_responsive_resizing|demonstration video]].
