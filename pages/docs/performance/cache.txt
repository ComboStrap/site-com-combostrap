====== ComboStrap - Cache ======


===== About =====
''cache'' is a simple and great feature that enhances [[docs:performance:performance|performance]]. 

''ComboStrap'' supports two three levels of cache:
  * Page
  * Slot
  * Image

===== Type =====
==== Page ====

==== Image ====
For images, ''ComboStrap'' supports two caches:
  * ''server cache'' that caches all processed image (for instance, [[docs:performance:svg_optimization|svg optimization]] but also [[docs:content:image#cropping|image resizing]])
  * ''browser cache'': all images are send to the browser with a cache instruction:
      * of an infinite amount of time 
      * if the image file has not changed.
