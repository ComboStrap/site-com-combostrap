====== ComboStrap - Public Front End Optimization ======


===== About =====
''public front end optimization'' is a [[:start|ComboStrap]] module that reduces the page overhead when a ''public'' / ''anonymous'' / ''search engine'' user is navigating your website in order to speed [[docs:performance:performance|performance]].



===== The goal =====

''ComboStrap'' is build only around:
  * [[docs:theme:bootstrap|BootStrap]].
  * and web components (ie the CSS is embedded in the page only when the component is used).

As the [[docs:theme:bootstrap|BootStrap file]] is distributed worldwide thanks to the Content delivery network, it reaches the computer user really really fast worldwide. 

Because we embrace the web component technology, we add to the page only the CSS and Javascript needed for each page to render. The page speed is then completely dependent on your server location and speed.

<note tip>
You can even [[doku>plugin:siteexport|generate the pages statically]] and store them globally on a Content delivery network.
</note>

===== Optimization and Configuration =====

==== Stylesheet ====

=== Minimize Backend Stylesheet ===
This option will not delete the backend stylesheet but will reduce the size of the Dokuwiki CSS file by removing the styling of backend plugin.

By default, this optimization is disabled.

You can enable it by changing the ''enableMinimalFrontEndCss'' [[docs:app:configuration|configuration]]



=== Disable Backend Stylesheet ===
You can even go a step further, if your front-end is completely based on ''ComboStrap'', you don't need to include the backend Stylesheet file for anonymous user.


By default, this optimization is disabled.

You can enable it by changing the ''disableDokuwikiStylesheet'' [[docs:app:configuration|configuration]]


<note important>
If you disable the backend stylesheet, the [[doku>interwiki#configuring_interwiki_shortcut_icons|interwiki icons]] will not show up anymore.
</note>
=== Enable Preload ===

<note warning>
We don't recommend to enable css preload because even if the rendering of your page will be faster, the page rendering will [[wp>Flash_of_unstyled_content|flikker]] if the network is slow leading to a bad user experience.
</note>

''preloadCss'' is a [[release:deprecated:strap|strap template]] configuration that enables [[https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/performance/resource-prioritization#preload|Css preloading]].



==== Javascript: Disable backend ====

If your front-end is completely based on ''ComboStrap'', you don't need to include third Javascript files that are used only for the backend. 

This configuration goes even further with [[docs:theme:bootstrap|bootstrap version 5]] and delete [[docs:utility:jquery|Jquery]].

<note important>
If you use any analytics plugin such as the [[docs:analytics:google_analytics|Google Analytics]] that relies on Javascript, you should not use/check this option.
</note>

If the configuration ''disableBackendJavascript'' is checked, the following javascript script will not be included in your pages:
  * ''js.php''
  * ''jquery.php'' (only for Bootstrap 5)
