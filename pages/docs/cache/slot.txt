====== Performance - Automatic Slot Cache Management ======


===== About =====
The ''secondary slots'' (ie [[docs:layout:page:side_slot|side]], [[docs:layout:page:sidekick_slot|sidekick]], [[:slot_main_footer|main footer]] slots, ...) content are always up-to-date and does not require to disable the [[docs:cache:page_expiration_frequency|page cache]], increasing [[docs:performance:performance|performance]].


<note>
If you have any [[https://www.dokuwiki.org/caching|%%~~NOCACHE~~%%]] instructions in your side slots, you can delete them to increase performance.
</note>


===== How it works =====

The syntax components advertise cache dependencies to the cache system.

For instance:
  * if you have a [[docs:navigation:page-explorer|page-explorer list]] in the [[docs:layout:page:side_slot|side]]
  * the cache system knows that if a page is added or deleted, it should re-render the side slot in the background.

<note>
You can see the dependencies, in the [[viewer|cache viewer]]
