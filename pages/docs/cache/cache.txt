===== About =====

''cache'' is a simple and great feature that enhances [[docs:performance:performance|performance]]. 

''ComboStrap'' has two levels of cache:
  * [[#Page]] (and [[#side slots]])
  * [[#Image]]

===== Type =====
==== Anonymous Page Cache ====

When a page is visited anonymously, an anonymous page is served from the [[public|public cache]]

==== Page Fragment ====


The parsing and rendering of a page in a different format are cached until some rules are met.

Learn them on this page: [[page]]





==== Secondary Slots ====

With the [[docs:cache:slot|auto slots cache bursting]], the slots are re-rendered in the background when they are stale.

For instance, if a secondary slot becomes stale due to the creation of a page or the modification of a primary metadata such as name, title, the secondary slot is rendered in the background showing up in the next request


<note>
Action: If you have any [[https://www.dokuwiki.org/caching|%%~~NOCACHE~~%%]] instructions in your slots, just delete them.
</note>


==== Background rendering ====
If a [[#secondary slots]] or a page becomes stale due to [[docs:cache:page_expiration_frequency|cache expiration frequency]], we re-render them in the background.

The first render is then stale but not the next one.

==== Image ====
For images, ''ComboStrap'' supports two caches:
  * ''server cache'' that caches all processed image (for instance, [[docs:performance:svg_optimization|svg optimization]] but also [[docs:content:image#cropping|image resizing]])
  * ''browser cache'' with the [[static|infinite static cache]] 


==== Javascript and Css Library  ====

With the [[static|infinite static cache functionality]], all Javascript and Css Libraries are cached for an infinite amount of time.
