====== ComboStrap - Cache ======


===== About =====
''cache'' is a simple and great feature that enhances [[docs:performance:performance|performance]]. 

''ComboStrap'' has two levels of cache:
  * [[#Page]] (and [[#side slots]])
  * [[#Image]]

===== Type =====
==== Page ====

All pages are cached until their content or any [[docs:configuration|app configuration]] is changed.

<note>
If you need to delete the page cache at interval because your page contains time-based data, you can use the [[:docs:cache:page|page cache expiration frequency]].
</note>

==== Side Slots ====


[[docs:layout:page:side_slot|Side slots]] are special pages for the cache because they used heavily the index when they show [[docs:navigation:navigation|navigational components]] and have then a great impact on the web server rendering time.

With the [[docs:cache:sideslots|side slots automatic cache bursting]], the only user impacted is the editor that is recreating the sidebar when he saves the page. And your reader or visitor will always benefit from this cache.

<note>
Action: If you have any [[https://www.dokuwiki.org/caching|%%~~NOCACHE~~%%]] instructions in your sidebar, just delete them.
</note>



==== Image ====
For images, ''ComboStrap'' supports two caches:
  * ''server cache'' that caches all processed image (for instance, [[docs:performance:svg_optimization|svg optimization]] but also [[docs:content:image#cropping|image resizing]])
  * ''browser cache'' with the [[static|infinite static cache]] 


==== Javascript and Css Library  ====

With the [[static|infinite static cache functionality]], all Javascript and Css Libraries are cached for an infinite amount of time.
