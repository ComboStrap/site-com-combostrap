====== ComboStrap URL Management - Redirection Actions ======

===== About =====
The ''redirection actions'' takes place in the [[redirection|redirection processing]] when:
  * the missing page id is not a [[docs:metadata:canonical|canonical]]
  * the missing page id does not have any [[page_rules|page rules]] that rewrite to an existing page id.
  * the user is not redirected to the [[edit|edit mode]] if it's a writer.

===== List =====
The following actions may be configured in order:
  * [[bestendpagename|Best end page name]]
  * [[bestpagename|Best page name]]
  * [[bestnamespace|Best namespace]]
  * [[search_engine|Search Engine]]

If an action does not find a page, the next action will try to find a page until the end. If no page is found, a [[search_engine|search engine]] redirect is performed.
