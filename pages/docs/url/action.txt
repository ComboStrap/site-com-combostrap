====== ComboStrap URL Management - Redirection Actions ======

===== About =====
The ''redirection actions'' takes place in the [[redirection|redirection processing]] when:
  * the missing page:
      * is not a [[docs:metadata:canonical|canonical]]
      * is not a [[docs:metadata:alias|alias]]
      * does not have any [[page_rules|page rules]] that applies for redirection
  * the user is:
      * a writer and is not redirected to the [[edit|edit mode]]
      * a reader


===== List =====
The following actions may be configured in order:
  * [[bestendpagename|Best end page name]]
  * [[bestpagename|Best page name]]
  * [[bestnamespace|Best namespace]]
  * [[search_engine|Search Engine]]

If an action does not find a page, the next action will try to find a page until the end. If no page is found, a [[search_engine|search engine]] redirect is performed.

===== Configuration =====

You can set the actions order in the [[:configuration|configuration]].
