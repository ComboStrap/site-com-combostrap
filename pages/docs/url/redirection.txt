====== ComboStrap URL Management - Redirection ======

===== About =====
''ComboStrap'' performs two kind of redirection:
    * an [[transparent|transparent redirection]] when the page has multiple known path.
    * an [[permanent|permanent redirection]] when the page has moved (visible by the user and search engine)


===== Automatic Redirection Processing =====

If the requested page at the path ''p'' does not exist:
  - if a page has a [[docs:metadata:canonical|canonical]] with the value ''p'', perform a [[docs:url:transparent|transparent redirection]]
  - if a page has an [[docs:metadata:alias|alias]] with the same value ''p'', redirect to this existing page 
      - with a [[permanent|permanent redirection (301)]] if the alias type is redirect
      - with a [[docs:url:transparent|transparent redirection]] if the alias type is synonym
  - if a [[page_rules|page rules redirect]] applies, redirect to the calculated page with a [[docs:url:permanent|permanent redirection]].
  - if the user has a write permission, redirect the writer to the ''edit'' form
  - if the user has only read permission, follow the [[action|redirect actions]] in the order of the configurations

===== History =====
You can query the redirection via the [[log|log]].
