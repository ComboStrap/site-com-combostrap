====== ComboStrap URL Management - Redirection ======

===== About =====
''ComboStrap'' performs two kind of redirection:
    * an [[path_redirect|Path redirect]] (transparent)
    * an [[redirect|HTTP redirect]] (visible by the user and search engine)


===== Processing =====

If the requested page at the path ''p'' does not exist:
  - if a page has a [[docs:metadata:canonical|canonical]] with the value ''p'', change the [[docs:metadata:path|path]] value to this existing page
  - if a page has an [[docs:metadata:alias|alias]] with the same value ''p'', redirect to this existing page with a permanent redirection (301)
  - if a [[page_rules|page rules redirect]] applies, redirect to the calculated page with a permanent redirection (301)
  - if the user has a write permission, redirect the writer to the ''edit'' form
  - if the user has only read permission, follow the [[action|redirect actions]] in the order of the configurations

===== History =====
You can query the redirection via the [[log|log]].
