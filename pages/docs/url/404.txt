====== ComboStrap URL - Missing Page (404) ======

===== About =====
A ''page'' may become unavailable if it has been:
  * moved
  * deleted
  * or renamed
In this case, the webserver should return a ''404 web page'' along with a [[wp>HTTP_404|hard HTTP 404 response]] (meaning that the ''Page Was Not Found'')



It hurts:
  * [[#user_experience|user experience]]
  * [[#user_experience|page views]]
  * [[#user_experience|ads revenue]]
  * and [[#domain_authority|domain authority]]


===== Missing pages effect =====

==== User experience ====
Showing a ''404 page'', next to the fact that this is not really friendly, generally means that your users end their navigation with the following consequences:
  * the [[kb>bounce/rate|bounce rate]] increases
  * the number of [[kb>page:views|page views]] decreases.
  * and if you are showing ''ads'', your revenue will decrease because you can't show ads on a ''404 page'' as it's a violation of ad policies. (Example with [[https://support.google.com/adspolicy/answer/6368661?hl=en|Google Ads]])

==== Domain Authority ====
[[kb>domain/authority|domain authority]] is a [[docs:seo:seo|SEO]] metrics based on [[kb>backlink#external|external backlinks]]. (A external backlink is a [[kb>hyperlink|hyperlink]] from a website to your website).

When your page does not exist and returns a ''404 response'', this backlinks are not validated and your are losing [[kb>domain/authority|authority]].


===== Solution =====

To avoid missing pages, ''ComboStrap'':
  * creates automatically [[docs:metadata:alias#redirect|redirect alias when pages are moved]].
  * allows you to create:
    * [[docs:metadata:alias|alias]] 
    * and/or [[docs:url:page_rules|redirection rules]]
  * implements [[docs:url:redirection|automatic redirection]].
