===== About =====
''permalink'' are links that are permanent and that will ''permanently'' be accessible even if the web page is [[support:plugin#move|moved]].


===== How to create a permalink ? =====


==== Generated ====

A generated permalink is a link that uses the [[docs:metadata:page_id|page id]] as [[docs:metadata:path|path]].

As the id is guaranteed to never change, it's the real / true permalink.


<webcode name="Default" frameborder="0">
  * You can add a permalink in your page with the ''permalink'' component.
<code dw>
<permalink/>
</code>
  * Result: The generated permalink for this page is:
</webcode>

\\

A generated permalink performs a [[docs:url:permanent|permanent redirection]]:
  * to the [[docs:metadata:canonical#url|canonical url]] (if its [[docs:metadata:canonical|canonical]] is not empty)
  * to the [[docs:metadata:path|page path]] (otherwise)

==== Named ====

A named permalink is a link that uses the [[docs:metadata:canonical|canonical]] as [[docs:metadata:path|path]]

Note that a [[docs:metadata:canonical|canonical]] is not a true permalink as it may be modified (It should not but you never know)


<webcode name="Default" frameborder="0">
  * You can add a named permalink in your page with the ''permalink'' component:
<code dw>
<permalink named/>
</code>
  * The named permalink for this page is:
</webcode>




A named permalink performs a [[docs:url:transparent|transparent redirection]].
