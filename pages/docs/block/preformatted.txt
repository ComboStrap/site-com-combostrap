====== ComboStrap UI - Preformatted (Indented code block) ======


===== About =====
''Preformatted '' is a syntax that considers any successive lines that starts with two spaces as a ''block of code''.

This is also known as ''indented code block'' and is a minimal syntax to create a [[code|block of code]] with no syntax highlighting.


<badge>[[release:archive:1.11|since 1.11]]</badge>

===== Syntax =====
A line that starts with a couple of spaces is seen as a [[code|code of block]] with no syntax highlighting. If you want to add a language, you need to use the [[code|code component]]
<code dw class="no-whitespace-normalization">
  Two spaces starts a block of code
</code>


<note>
Without any content, the ''indented code block'' is not printed. You can disable this feature with the [[#preformattedEmptyContentNotPrintedEnable|preformattedEmptyContentNotPrintedEnable configuration]]
