====== ComboStrap - Mermaid diagrams ======


===== About =====
''mermaid'' is a library that renders diagram/chart based on a markup definition.

To ease the creation of mermaid diagram, we have created the following component that accepts directly the mermaid diagram definition

  * [[:docs:diagram:erd]]
  * [[..:diagram:gantt]]
  * [[..:diagram:flowchart]]
  * [[docs:diagram:piechart]]
  * [[..:diagram:sequence]]
  * [[:docs:diagram:state]]
  * [[:docs:diagram:user-journey]]



If for any reason, you wanted to show up also the diagram definition, you can use the below ''mermaid''.

===== Syntax =====

To render a mermaid diagram, you just need to enclose a [[docs:block:code|code block]] with [[https://mermaid-js.github.io/mermaid/#/|mermaid diagram definition language]] inside a ''mermaid'' block.

<note>
Mermaid offers a [[https://mermaid-js.github.io/mermaid-live-editor|live editor]] that you can use to validate and develop your diagrams.
</note>

```dw
<mermaid>
    <code mermaid display="none">
    ... mermaid diagram definition
    </code>
</railroad>
```

<note>
''display="none"'' is added to show you how to not print a [[docs:block:code|code block]] but this is optional.
</note>

===== Example =====


<webcode name="State" frameborder="0">
  * With a [[docs:diagram:state|state diagram]]
```dw
<mermaid>
<code mermaid>
stateDiagram-v2
    Direction LR
    [*] --> Still
    Still --> [*]
    Still --> Moving
    Moving --> Still
    Moving --> Crash
    Crash --> [*]
</code>
</mermaid>
```
  * Output:
</webcode>


===== Security =====
On a [[:security|security level]]:
  * the [[https://mermaid-js.github.io/mermaid/#/usage?id=securitylevel|level of security]] is set to ''strict'' 
  * and we does not authorize ''script'', ''style'', ''iframe'' tag and ''on'' attribute handler.
