====== Search Index Manager ======


===== About =====
The [[doku>plugin:searchindex|search index manager]] is a [[:support:plugin|supported plugin]] that will recreate the [[#search index]]

If you change a lot of page or after a [[release:update|release]], the ''search index manager'' should be run to update/rebuild the index.

===== Search Index =====

The ''search index'' is an index of your page that powers:
  * the [[docs:menubar:search|search component]] 
  * the [[:docs:navigation:backlink|backlinks]]
  * the [[:docs:templating:sql|page sql]]
  * the [[:docs:page:move|page move]]
  * and every component that makes a query.

The index is updated (([[doku>search|search index update]])) incrementally page by page when a visitor see a page.


<note important>
The [[:docs:page:move|move plugin]] depends on it to retrieve the backlinks and make the corresponding rewrite

If you don't want to create [[docs:quality:broken_link|broken links]] don't forget to rebuild your index if you have added pages externally (ie moved from an other installation via the file system, not via the web interface)
</note>

===== Install and Access =====

  * You can install it with the [[doku>plugin:extension|extension manager]].
  * You access it on the admin page via the ''admin'' action of the [[docs:theme:element:railbar|railbar]]

  * select the ''combo'' database
  * enter the following query and execute
<code>
SELECT count(1) from pages;
</code>
  * The result will give you the number of pages indexed.
