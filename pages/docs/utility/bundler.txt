====== Page Bundler ======


===== About =====
The ''page bundler'' is an utility that will create one single page from all descendant pages of an [[:docs:page:system:index|index page]].

===== Example =====

For instance, click on this <btn>[[:howto:getting_started:getting_started?do=combo_pagebundler|link]]</btn> to get the [[:howto:getting_started:getting_started|Getting started guide section]] into one page.


You can then create a [[howto:pdf|pdf file]].
===== How it works =====

You need to add the following query ''?do=combo_pagebundler'' to the URL of the [[:docs:page:system:index|index page]]. It will then bundle all descendants pages into one page.


<code uri>
?do=combo_pagebundler
</code>

===== Limitations =====

Because this is a heavy task, this task is limited to:
  * for anonymous user:
      * 5 pages (so no crawler will load your server)
      * ''max execution time'' is the maximum time of the server (in php.ini, 30 second by default)
  * for logged in user:
      * no pages limitation
      * ''max execution time'' is 5 minutes.
