====== ComboStrap Page Metadata - Language Region ======


===== About =====
The ''region'' code localized the page geographically at a region level and is used to generate the [[docs:locale:locale|locale setting]]


Example: the french language is present in the region:
  * ''CA'' (Canada), 
  * ''FR'' (France)

This regions even if they have the same language may have different formatting such as the thousand separator or decimal points.


The [[..:social:google|google search engine]] uses this information to localize your content.

===== Set =====


You can set a ''region'' code:
  * in the [[docs:metadata:manager|manager]] to localize a specific page.
  * in the [[#configuration|configuration]] to set it for the whole website



The format supported is the ISO 3166 alpha-2 country code.
The complete list of values can be found on Wikipedia on this page: [[wp>List_of_ISO_3166_country_codes|list of ISO3166 country codes]]

===== Default =====

The default value is set in the [[#siteLanguageRegion]] configuration.

If there is no value, the locale server country is retrieved (if the [[support:requirement|internationale extension is installed]])
===== Configuration =====
