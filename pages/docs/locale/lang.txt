====== How to set the Language (Lang) ? ======


===== About =====

In ComboStrap, you can define a language:
  * for the [[:docs:app:lang|whole application]] (the default value for all pages)
  * or for each [[:docs:page:lang|page]]


===== Value =====

The language is identified by language identifier known as the ''lang'' [[..:metadata:metadata|metadata]].


It is a 2 letters code that follows the [[https://www.loc.gov/standards/iso639-2/php/English_list.php|ISO 639-2 specification]] .

Example:
  * ''en'' (English),
  * ''fr'' (French)
  * ''nl'' (Dutch)
  * ''ar'' (Arabic). (See [[#rtlright_to_left_language|Right-to-left language support]])

===== Usage =====

The language identifier is used:
  * in the [[..:locale:locale|locale]] to localize the page for external [[:docs:social:social|social thrid party]]
  * by the [[:strap|strap template]] to set the lang and direction of the HTML document

===== Direction =====
Each language has an intrinsic value that is known as the direction:
  * ''LTR'' or ''left to right'', you read the text from left to right
  * ''RTL'' or ''right to left'', you read the text from right to left
  * ''TTB'' or ''top-to-bottom'', you read the text from top to bottom

ComboStraps supports
  * ''LTR''
  * ''RTL'' with the default bootstrap theme. We have created a page in ''arabic'' that has a language direction from [[#rtlright_to_left_language|right-to-left (''rtl'')]] See the demo page: [[lang_ar]]


===== Support =====



==== RTL: Right to left language ====

As ''bootswatch'' does not support yet RTL languages, you need to set your [[docs:utility:bootstrap|Bootstrap version at minimal to 5 with the bootstrap theme]].

Example with the version ''5.01 - bootstrap'':
