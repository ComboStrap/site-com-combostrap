===== Why ? =====

''side slots'' contains generally [[ui:navigation|navigational component]] such as a [[ui:ntoc|list of page]]. Therefore, their content becomes generally stale when a page is modified, added or deleted. 

The basic solution is to disable cache but this action has an important impact on [[:performance|performance]] because they read the index.

The cache:
  * is scoped to the namespace (directory) of the requested page
  * is automatically deleted when a page of this namespace is modified, added or deleted
