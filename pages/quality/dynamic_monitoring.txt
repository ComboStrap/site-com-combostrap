====== ComboStrap Quality - Dynamic Page Monitoring ======


===== About =====
''Dynamic Quality Page Monitoring'' is a feature that encourages the ''writer'' (users with edit permission) to improve the [[score|quality score]] of its page. 

A message is shown that indicates the [[rule|quality rules]] that can be improved and how.

You can exclude [[rule|quality rules]] from ''Dynamic Monitoring'' via [[#configuration]].


===== Example =====

For the low quality page demo ([[low_quality_example|low quality demo page]]), you would get the below note if you had the ''edit'' authorization.

<quality page-id="low_quality_example"/>
===== Configuration =====
==== Excluded Quality Rules ====
The [[:configuration|configuration]] ''excludedQualityRulesFromDynamicMonitoring'' lists the [[rule|quality rules]] that should not be monitored.

If you had a [[rule|quality rule]] in this list, it will not show up in the message.
