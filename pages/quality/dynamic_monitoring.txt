====== ComboStrap Quality - Dynamic Page Monitoring ======


===== About =====
''Dynamic Quality Page Monitoring'' is a feature that encourages the ''writer'' (users with edit permission) to improve the [[score|quality score]] of its page. 

A message is shown for [[rule|quality rules]] that don't pass, indicating how they can be improved.

For a page that is not an article such as home page or landing page, you can also [[##disable_for_a_page|disable it]].




===== Example =====

For the low quality page demo ([[low_quality_example|low quality demo page]]), you would get the below note if you had the ''edit'' authorization.

<quality page-id="low_quality_example"/>

===== When the message shows up =====

The message is shown when:
  * [[rule|quality rules]] (that were not [[#excluded rules]]) don't pass
  * the [[low_quality_page|low quality page indicator]] has not been [[low_quality_page#manuall|set manually to false]]
===== Configuration =====
==== Excluded Quality Rules ====
The [[:configuration|configuration]] ''excludedQualityRulesFromDynamicMonitoring'' lists the [[rule|quality rules]] that should not be monitored.

If you had a [[rule|quality rule]] in this list, it will not show up in the message.


==== Disable for a page====

You can disable the ''dynamic quality monitoring'' feature by setting the property ''dynamic_quality_monitoring'' in the [[semantic:frontmatter|frontmatter]] to ''false''.

Example:
<code javascript>
{
    "dynamic_quality_monitoring":"false"
}
</code>

 
==== Disable totally ====

You can disable totally the ''dynamic quality monitoring'' feature by selecting the [[:configuration|configuration disableDynamicQualityMonitoring]].
