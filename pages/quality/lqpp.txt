====== ComboStrap Quality - Low Quality Page Protection (LQPP) ======


===== About =====
If your website has a lot of [[quality:low_quality_page|low quality page]]:
  * your [[:seo|SEO]] score will be lower
  * you can even get at worse the [[#Thin content with little or no added value]] penalty and be deleted from the search engine inde.


This feature if [[#enable|enabled]] makes [[quality:low_quality_page|low quality page]] no more discoverable by Search Engine and prevents you to be banned by [[kb>search:engine|Search Engine]].

<badge>Since [[:changes|version 1.11]]</badge>

===== Thin content with little or no added value =====
The ''Thin content with little or no added value'' is explained in the [[https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/9044175#thin-content|webmaster documentation]]

If you are going to the [[kb>google:search:console|Google Search Console]], you would see the following alert.

<note warning>
This site appears to contain a significant percentage of low-quality or shallow pages that do not provide users with much added value (such as thin affiliate pages, cookie-cutter sites, doorway pages, automatically generated content or copied content).
</note>

The effect is that:
  * Your website is deleted from the [[kb>search:engine|Search Engine Index]]
  * Your website will then be no more discoverable
  * and your visits will plunge.

===== Demo =====

We have created a low page demo to show you the protection in action.
  * Link: This is a  [[low_quality_example|internal link to the low quality page]]. If you are hovering over it, it will shows a [[ui:tooltip|tooltip]] asking you to log in in order to see the link with the ''LQPP'' acronym that stands for ''Low Quality Page Protection''

  * Mode: The [[#mode|protection mode]] of this website is ''hidden'' which means that everybody with an external link can still navigate to this page. For instance, if you click on this external link [[https://combostrap.com/quality/low_quality_example|low quality demo page]], you should be able to see the ''hidden'' low quality page.

===== Configuration =====
==== Enable ====
This protection is disabled by default. If you want to enable it, you need to check the ''lowQualityPageProtectionEnable'' checkbox [[:configuration|configuration]].


<note>
A protection becomes active for a page when it was analyzed.

It happens slowly:
  * for every page visited 
  * or for every page that gains or lost backlinks.

If you want to update all pages in batch, you can do it with the ''cli'' on the server.
<code bash>
cd $DOKUWIKI_HOME
./bin/plugin.php combo analytics
</code>
</note>
==== Mode ====
The protection mode determines how the page is protected from Search Engine.

There is two possibilities:
  * [[quality:automatic_hidden|Hidden]] (default) - The page is still accessible directly but is not searchable. A visitor coming from an external link (such as backlinks or email) will be able to see the page but the page will not be advertised to Search Engine.
  * ''ACL'' (''Access Control Lists'') - The page is not accessible to anonymous user. The user needs to log in to see the page.
