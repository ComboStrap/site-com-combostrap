====== ComboStrap Quality - Low Quality Page Protection (LQPP) ======


===== About =====
If your website has a lot of [[quality:low_quality_page|low quality page]]:
  * your [[:seo|SEO]] score will be lower
  * you can even get at worse the [[#Thin content with little or no added value]] penalty and be deleted from the search engine inde.


This feature if [[#enable|enabled]] makes [[quality:low_quality_page|low quality page]] no more discoverable by Search Engine and prevents you to be banned by [[kb>search:engine|Search Engine]].

<badge>Since [[release:release|version 1.11]]</badge>

===== Thin content with little or no added value =====
The ''Thin content with little or no added value'' is explained in the [[https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/9044175#thin-content|webmaster documentation]]

If you are going to the [[kb>google:search:console|Google Search Console]], you would see the following alert.

<note warning>
This site appears to contain a significant percentage of low-quality or shallow pages that do not provide users with much added value (such as thin affiliate pages, cookie-cutter sites, doorway pages, automatically generated content or copied content).
</note>

The effect is that:
  * Your website is deleted from the [[kb>search:engine|Search Engine Index]]
  * Your website will then be no more discoverable
  * and your visits will plunge.

===== Demo =====

We have created a low page demo to show you the protection in action.
  * Link: This is a  [[low_quality_example|internal link to the low quality page]]. If you are hovering over it, it will shows a [[docs:content:tooltip|tooltip]] asking you to log in in order to see the link with the ''LQPP'' acronym that stands for ''Low Quality Page Protection''

  * Mode: The [[#protection mode|protection mode]] of this website is ''hidden'' which means that everybody with an external link can still navigate to this page. For instance, if you click on this external link [[https://combostrap.com/quality/low_quality_example|low quality demo page]], you should be able to see the ''hidden'' low quality page.

===== Configuration =====
==== Enable ====
This protection is disabled by default. If you want to enable it, you need to check the ''lowQualityPageProtectionEnable'' checkbox [[:configuration|configuration]].


<note>
A protection becomes active for a page when [[analytics:process|it was analyzed]].
</note>
==== Protection Mode ====
The [[protection|protection mode]] determines how a [[low quality page|low quality page]] is protected from Search Engine.


===== Support =====
==== The link does not appear as a low quality page protected link ====

This module uses the [[analytics:process|analytical process]] that ''cache'' the data by default. If you want to see the links, you should [[analytics:process#cache|clear the cache]].
