===== About =====

===== The goal =====

''ComboStrap'' is build only around:
  * the [[strap:bootstrap|BootStrap CSS file]].
  * and web components (ie the CSS is embedded in the page only when the component is used).

As the [[strap:bootstrap|BootStrap file]] is distributed worldwide thanks to the Content delivery network, it reaches the computer user really quickly. 

Because we embrace the web component technology, we add to the page only the CSS needed to render for each component to render. 

The page speed is then completely dependent on where your server is located.

<note tip>
If you [[doku>plugin:siteexport|generate the pages statically]] and store them also from a Content delivery network, the speed is optimal.
