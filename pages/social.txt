====== ComboStrap - Social ======


===== About =====
''social'' is a [[:seo|SEO module]] that helps to improve:
  * the [[#discoverability|discoverability]]
  * and the [[#interaction|interaction]] with your users.


===== Discoverability =====

The discoverability module is based on data that are added to your page such as:
  * the type of page
  * an image
  * your handle
The social and search engine network uses this data to:
  * style your page (ie create cards while sharing a link to your page)
  * index your pages to their search engine or in category pages.

All three majors social platform have been implemented:
  * [[semantic:twitter|<icon name="twitter"/> Twitter Meta]]
  * [[semantic:twitter|<icon name="facebook"/> Facebook Meta]]
  * [[semantic:google|<icon name="google"/> Google Meta]]


<note>
As a general rule of thumb, all social images should be at least 640×320px (1280×640px for best display).

To be sure that nothing gets cropped, you could create a 40pt white margin around your image.
</note>
===== Interaction =====
Interaction happens through widgets embedded in your pages.

Actually, only the [[ui:tweet|embedded tweet]] has been implemented.
