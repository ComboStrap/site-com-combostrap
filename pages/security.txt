====== Security ======

===== About =====
In [[start|combostrap]], we are taking security very seriously.

===== Prevention =====
Below are the steps that we have taken to prevent the following attack.
==== Cross-site request attack ====

Every form uses a token to prevent a [[kb>csrf|cross-site request attack (CSRF)]])

==== Injection Attack ====
To prevent an [[kb>injection/attack|injection attack]]
  * every HTML output is escaped to prevent HTML/Javascript injection.
  * every SQL input is passed through parameters to prevent [[kb>sql/injection|SQL injection]]
  * every [[docs:content:svg|SVG]] got the ''script'' node deleted.

==== Content Security Policy ====

We apply the [[https://w3c.github.io/webappsec-csp/|Content Security Policy framework]].

By default, we disallow:
    * the framing of the website to prevent clickjacking.
    * the use of ''http'' and ''https'' at the same time

==== No leak ====

We set the ''Referrer-Policy'' to not send private URL to external domain.
===== Dokuwiki =====
''Dokuwiki'' follows also this rules (see [[doku>devel:security]]). We are making use of the CSRF token functionality.

===== Reporting Security Issues =====
For any security concern or issue, you can contact us at [[security@combostrap.com]]
