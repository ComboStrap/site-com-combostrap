====== Security ======

===== About =====
In [[start|combostrap]], we are taking security very seriously.

===== Prevention =====
Below are the steps that we have taken to prevent the following attack.
==== Cross-site request attack ====

Every form uses a token to prevent a [[kb>csrf|cross-site request attack (CSRF)]])

==== Injection Attack ====
To prevent an [[kb>injection/attack|injection attack]]
  * every HTML output is escaped to prevent HTML/Javascript injection.
  * every SQL input is passed through parameters to prevent [[kb>sql/injection|SQL injection]]

===== Dokuwiki =====
''Dokuwiki'' follows also this rules (see [[doku>devel:security]]). We are making use of the CSRF token functionality.

===== Reporting Security Issues =====
For any security concern or issue, you can contact us at [[security@combostrap.com]]
