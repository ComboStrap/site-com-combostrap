====== Backup ======


===== About =====
This article lists  data of interest that should go into a minimal backup
of a DokuWiki Installation

The complete list is available on the [[doku>faq:backup|backup documentation page]]

===== Image Salt =====
To avoid a DDOS with image processing, Dokuwiki adds a signature.

The signature is the value of the `tok` Url property.

This is:
  * a md5 hash
  * of length 6
  * from the wiki id, the dimension (width and height)
  * with a salt randomly generated and stored in one of this file:
```
data\meta\_htcookiesalt
data\meta\_htcookiesalt2
```

If you are using a cache, don't forget to back up this file well
otherwise the images will not show up.

The detailed function is the `media_get_token` in `media.php`
