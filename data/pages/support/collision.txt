====== How to resolve a Page Collision on the page id?  ======



===== Problem =====
When replicating pages between Combostrap applications, you may encounter this error.
<console>
The page (xxxx) and the page (xxxx) have the same page id value (xxx)
</console>

===== Resolution =====
To resolve this error, you need to synchronize the database with the file system.

On the server where Combostrap is installed, you should run this command:
  * for a single installation
<code bash>
cd $DOKUWIKI_HOME
php ./bin/plugin.php combo sync
</code>
  * for a farm
<code bash>
cd $DOKUWIKI_HOME
animal=example.com php ./bin/plugin.php combo sync
</code>
