====== How to resolve the memory error when updating? ======


===== The problem =====
When trying to update Combstrap or a third-party plugin, you may get an exhausted memory error. This article shows you how to avoid this error.

{{:support:fatal-exception-exhausted-memory.png|}}


<console>
dokuwiki\Exception\FatalException: Allowed memory size of 536870912 bytes exhausted (tried to allocate 20480 bytes)
An unforeseen error has occurred. This is most likely a bug somewhere. It might be a problem in the combo plugin.

More info has been written to the DokuWiki error log.
</console>



===== Why do we get this error? =====

The update script of DokuWiki scans the directories and updates file by file. You even need to list the [[doku>install:unused_files|unused/deleted file]] otherwise they are not deleted.

This scan runs out of memory because ComboStrap has a lot of files.


===== How to resolve this error? =====


To resolve this error, you need to:
  * For ''Combo'': update it manually via the ''manual install'' tab. This step is explained in the [[:release:update|update documentation]].
  * For a third-party plugin
     * Disable ''Combo'' before updating a third-party plugin
     * or install it manually via the ''manual install'' tab
