====== Third Party Plugins ======


===== About =====
This page is an optional and informative step that highlights important information that you should now about third party plugins.

[[:combostrap|ComboStrap]] supports [[:support:plugin|third party plugins]] and you can see them all on their  [[:support:plugin|dedicated page]].


You can install any plugin the same way as [[howto:server_installation:2_combo|Combo]] with the [[doku>plugin:extension|extension manager]].



===== Highlights =====
We recommend to install the two below plugins.
==== Move ====

We support the [[docs:page:move|move plugin]]

You can quickly move a page with the ''rename'' action in the [[docs:theme:element:railbar|railbar]].

==== Search Index Manager ====

We support also the [[:docs:utility:search_index_manager|Search Index Manager]]

It will:
  * recreate the index of all pages.
  * update the combostrap database.

You should use it:
  * if you move pages on the server via the file system (for instance in case of a new installation)
  * after each [[release:update|new release]]



===== Support =====
==== Plugin and Combostrap update ====

After an installation, if you want to update a plugin or Combostrap and if you have a memory error, 
you need to [[:release:update|update them via the manual install procedure]].


==== Plugin support ====

We support all plugins that are working with a standard dokuwiki installation.

If you have any problems with a third party plugin:
  * check the [[support:plugin|plugin page]] to see if there is already a solution.
  * if not, [[:support|contact us or open a ticket]]






===== Next Step =====

That's it, you should have no a full functional server installed with DokuWiki.
