====== ComboStrap Getting Started - Combo Installation ======

===== About =====
''combo'' contains all components:
  * The [[docs:theme:theme|theme]]
  * The [[docs:component|collection of UI component]]
  * The [[docs:router:router|router]]
  * The [[docs:metadata:metadata|Page Metadata]]
  * The [[docs:seo:seo|SEO module]]
  * and many more.


===== Steps =====

==== Pre-requisites and options not supported ====


**Last Dokuwiki Version**: \\
In case, you have not followed the [[howto:getting_started:1_dokuwiki|dokuwiki step]], you should install ''ComboStrap'' on the last DokuWiki version. \\
If you don't know the version of your installation, the [[..:getting_started:1_dokuwiki#dokuwiki_version_check|dokuwiki version check]] will help you.

**DokuWiki Internal rewriting**: \\
Because of the [[:docs:page:url|permanent url functionality]], Combostrap:
      * does not support the [[doku>rewrite#option_1web_server|URL DokuWiki Internal rewriting (option 2)]] 
      * but supports [[https://combostrap.com/admin/nice-url-noln5keo|nice url via the web server]]

==== Go to the Extension Manager ====

To install the ''Combo'' plugin:
  * Click on the ''Admin'' link to go to the [[doku>admin_window|Admin Window]]. ie ''https://yourdomain.com/?do=admin''

{{::dokuwiki_admin_window_default_template.png|}}

  * Click on the ''Extension Manager'' link to go to the [[doku>plugin:extension|Extension Manager plugin]].
  * Click on the ''Search and Install'' link to go to the ''Search tab''

==== Install the SQLite extension ====

''combo'' is saving its data in a sqlite database and therefore uses this extension.

  * Search for the term ''sqlite''
  * Click on the ''install'' button.

==== Do you have any other plugins ? ====

''ComboStrap'' is tested against [[howto:server_installation:4_plugin|third party plugins]] but we can't test them all.

This application has a large code base going from [[:docs:cache:cache|cache]] to [[docs:router:router|routing]] and [[docs:component|user interface]] management.

Plugins that are too old or do not respect the DokuWiki Interfaces may not work well with ''ComboStrap''.

==== Install the Combo extension ====

Because of the [[support:oom|memory error of the update plugin]], Combo needs to be updated manually via the ''manual install'' tab.

  * In the [[doku>plugin:extension|extension manager]], click on the ''manual install'' tab
  * Enter the Github Url: ''https://github.com/ComboStrap/combo/archive/main.zip''
  * Check the box ''Overwrite existing files''
  * And click the ''install'' button.

==== Do you have a broken Installation? ====

If this is the case and that you got your installation not working anymore, the fix is:
  * to rename on your server the directory ''dokuwiki/lib/plugins/combo'' to ''dokuwiki/lib/plugins/combo.old''
  * or to delete it

And to [[:support|send us the log of your webserver]] if you want us to take a look.
===== Next Step =====

All good? Well done, otherwise check the [[#do_you_have_a_broken_installation|broken installation section]] if you need to recover your installation.
