====== How to install DokuWiki and Combostrap on a Server? ======


===== About =====
This series of article is intended to help you get a DokuWiki instance installed on a
server with a Linux/Windows operating system.


===== Support =====

This part is crucial for performance reason. 

It's not 1, 2, 3 as you need to have a broad knowledge of:
  * Linux/Windows
  * ssh, 
  * php, 
  * php extension, opcache
  * and many components

If you struggle, you can:
  * try our [[:docs:admin:docker|Docker Image]] that install a whole environment in one line of code
  * [[:support|contact us]]

For more information, you can also visit the [[doku>install|DokuWiki Install page]]

===== Steps =====


==== Download DokuWiki ====

[[https://download.dokuwiki.org/|Download the last Dokuwiki]],

==== Server requirement ====
Verify that your php server has the [[support:requirement|minimum requirements]]:
      * [[support:requirement#php|php version supported]]: ''7.4'' to ''8.2''
      * and [[support:requirement#moduleextension|php extensions]]

==== Upload and unzip the DokuWiki Archive ====

You should:
  * Upload the zip file to your web server
  * Unzip it to your web directory

==== Run the installer ====

You can access the [[doku>installer|installer page]] at ''https://yourdomain.com/install.php''

  * Answer the install form. Choose:
     * at minimal the [[doku>config:useacl|ACL option]], otherwise you get no access to the admin page
     * the `read` permission, otherwise the [[:docs:app:logo|logo]] and [[:howto:getting_started:6_favicon|favicon]] will not render
  * Done
