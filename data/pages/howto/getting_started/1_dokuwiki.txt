====== How to get DokuWiki Up and Running? ======

===== About =====
Because [[:combostrap|ComboStrap]] is built on top of the [[doku>|Dokuwiki Engine]], the first step is to have a DokuWiki app up and running.

This article will show you how.


===== Docker / Server =====

This tutorial series uses our [[:docs:admin:docker|Docker image]] for consistency 
but if you have a standalone server and want to install DokuWiki on it, you can also follow this [[howto:server_installation:start|tutorial series]].



===== Steps =====

We recommend greatly to use our [[:docs:admin:docker|DokuWiki in Docker image]] as:
  * it's the easiest way to get DokuWiki up and running
  * it contains all performance cache system (php-fpm and opcache)
  * a Server DokuWiki installation is not easy and straightforward
  * and [[:docs:admin:docker#features|more]].


==== Install Docker ====


Download the Docker binary or install a package as explained on this [[https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/|article]].


==== On Windows? ====

On Windows, you need to install WSL by following this [[https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install|instructions]]. 
Why? Because Php is still a Linux and C technology that is really slow on Windows. This is architectural as explained on [[https://github.com/docker/for-win/issues/6742|this issue]]

==== Create a data directory  ====
  * Create a directory to store the DokuWiki Data
<code bash>
mkdir -p ~/site-combo-starter
</code>
  * And go into it to change the current directory
<code bash>
cd site-combo-starter
</code>

==== Start DokuWiki in Docker ====

Start a DokuWiki Docker Instance with the following command.
<code bash>
docker run \
  --name site-combo-starter \
  --rm \
  -p 8080:80 \
  --user 1000:1000 \
  -e DOKU_DOCKER_ACL_POLICY='public' \
  -e DOKU_DOCKER_ADMIN_NAME='admin' \
  -e DOKU_DOCKER_ADMIN_PASSWORD='welcome' \
  -v $PWD:/var/www/html \
  ghcr.io/combostrap/dokuwiki:php8.3-latest
</code>
where:
  * ''DOKU_DOCKER_ACL_POLICY='public''' will configure a wiki that can only be seen by the public. You need to login to modify it.
  * ''DOKU_DOCKER_ADMIN_NAME='admin''' create a user named ''admin'' with the ''admin'' permission.
  * ''DOKU_DOCKER_ADMIN_PASSWORD='welcome''' is the password of the admin user
  * ''%%-v $PWD:/var/www/html%%'' mount your current directory ''PWD'' into the image at the HTML server root ''/var/www/html'' 
  * ''--user 1000:1000'' will create file as if it were you creating them. The user ''1000'' is the UID of your Desktop user (in Windows WSL at least)






==== Check that the instance has started ====

The command above will:
  * start php, 
  * install DokuWiki, 
  * install the [[https://github.com/ComboStrap/site-starter|starter site]]
  * and is ready when you see this lines:
<console>
INFO success: caddy entered RUNNING state, process has stayed up for > than 1 seconds (startsecs)
INFO success: php_error_log entered RUNNING state, process has stayed up for > than 1 seconds (startsecs)
INFO success: php_fpm entered RUNNING state, process has stayed up for > than 1 seconds (startsecs)
</console>
  * You can then access DokuWiki at http://localhost:8080

<note>
=== How to stop the instance ===

If you want to stop the instance:
  * you can press ''Control+C'' with your keyboard in the current terminal
  * Or you can open another terminal and stop it with the following command
<code bash>
docker stop site-combo-starter
</code>
</note>


==== Login ====


Go to the [[http://localhost:8080/?do=login|login page]]: http://localhost:8080/?do=login

And enter the credentials:
  * user: ''admin''
  * password: ''welcome''
