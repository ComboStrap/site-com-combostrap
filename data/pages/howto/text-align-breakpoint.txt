====== How to align a text based on screen size ? ======


===== About =====
This [[howto:howto|howto]] shows you how to apply a [[:howto:text-align|text alignment]] that depends on the screen size.


In the [[:howto:text-align|text align howto]], you have learned to apply one of the tree possible text alignment.

In this howto, you will see how you can apply this alignment based on the [[:docs:styling:breakpoint|screen size]] (mobile, desktop, ...)

All text alignment are done via the [[:docs:styling:align|align attribute]]. This attribute supports what we called [[:docs:styling:conditional|conditional value]]. By adding a [[:docs:styling:breakpoint|breakpoint value]] as suffix, you will enable this value from this screen size.

===== Example =====


This example was made with the [[docs:block:text|text component]] and shows a conditional value based on [[docs:styling:breakpoint|screen size]].

To see them in action, you should resize your browser windows.
