===== Custom Bootstrap Theme ===== 

==== By creating your own Stylesheet ====

You can even create and install your [[howto:bootstrap-custom|custom stylesheet]].

This is an advanced configuration and requires some programming skills but this is not out of reach. See [[howto:bootstrap-custom]]


==== By using your own CSS variables ====

You can make use of [[:docs:theme:css-variable|bootstrap CSS variables]] to customize your stylesheet.
