====== Release 1.25.4 ======



===== About =====
This is a version not yet released.


===== List =====

==== New ====
  * [[:docs:admin:docker|DokuWiki Docker]] - A new way to develop and publish ComboStrap WebSite with Docker
  * [[:docs:admin:website|ComboStrap WebSite]] - A ComboStrap WebSite permits to develop and publish website collaboratively (locally or remotely)
  * A new utility: the [[:docs:utility:bundler|page bundler]]. It may be handy when you want to create a [[:howto:pdf|single document (pdf)]] from multiples pages.


==== Bug ====

  * [[https://github.com/ComboStrap/combo/issues/106|Bug]] reported by [[https://github.com/jkiser99dev|jkiser99dev]]: ''base rewrite'' was messing up with the CDN url.
  * [[https://github.com/ComboStrap/combo/issues/109|Bug]] - the dismiss on popover was preventing any link to work. We took over and have implemented our own dismiss with a ''mousedown'' event. The impacted elements were:
      * [[:docs:theme:slot:slot_manager|The slot manager]]
      * [[:docs:navigation:historical_breadcrumb|The historical breadcrumb]]
  * [[:docs:router:router|]]: Infinite Redirect because the ID was not cleaned when retrieving it.
  * [[:docs:admin:nice-url|Nice URL]]: When Nice URL is on, the configuration useSlash should also be enabled otherwise the static resource returns an internal error. Dokuwiki breaks if the file path returned a file that does not exist
  * [[:docs:analytics:replication|Database Sync]]: the database sync uses a lock that is deleted at the end by a shutdown function. In php 8.3, this function should not print any debug statement otherwise the [[doku>TaskRunner]] returns no response (ie gif) even if successfull.
  * [[:docs:router:ban|Ban]] was not working. We checked at the very first event but as in the last DokuWiki, the Authorization is handled by a class, the new checks were not working and gave no permissions to see the home page. We make now the ban check at the [[doku>devel:event:dokuwiki_init_done|dokuwiki_init_done]] event.
  * The [[:docs:theme:template:hamburger|hamburger template]] was missing the title
  * [[:docs:admin:docker|DokuWiki Docker]] got a second image pool with better default sizing to avoid OOM error
  * `ComboStrap\ExceptionNotFound: No database row found for the page`: An exception was not caught in the router. [[https://github.com/ComboStrap/combo/commit/b1aef5347afbf2a2acc6b03406098007d8ba91ef|Commit]]
  * `Error: No mime found for path`: An exception was thrown when a mime could not be found. It has been set to binary by default. [[https://github.com/ComboStrap/combo/commit/39c00e7ee80f440398e043c1b028639b65574701|Commit]]
  * Binary was not set as mime but as string, resulting to ''Error: Call to a member function toString() on string'' [[https://github.com/ComboStrap/combo/commit/997da5972fe7174e36e252b9bc916d648326c198|Commit]]
  * The [[:docs:page:canonical|canonical]] was by default set to wiki path and not to the default value. [[https://github.com/ComboStrap/combo/commit/2d4863144e14613de4de42a4560d2738664cbc0e|Commit]]

  * The router has been completely rewritten to catch ''TOO_MANY_REDIRECT'' browser error. [[https://github.com/ComboStrap/combo/commit/45a874f4355f8bee7459e5d3b79e86e68468b316|Commit]]
  * The database row collision detection was throwing an error stopping the sync. We known report an error in the log. [[https://github.com/ComboStrap/combo/commit/c0705265c76e59176d9f02515cf7dcf68d9c4862|c0705265c76e59176d9f02515cf7dcf68d9c4862]]

==== Improvement ====
  * Deleted warnings caused by php8.3 about array and other php7 construct.
  * InterWiki: We put the interwiki name in lowercase (mandatory).
  * The logging system uses the dokuwiki logging. [[https://github.com/ComboStrap/combo/commit/39c00e7ee80f440398e043c1b028639b65574701|Commit]]
  * Browser User autocomplete for the logging page. [[https://github.com/ComboStrap/combo/commit/858cf17eaf876d049c21c4b2fd66da5ea3852ff2|Commit]]
