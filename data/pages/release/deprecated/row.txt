====== Deprecated Component - Row ======


===== About =====
With the advent of [[:docs:theme:theme|theme]], complex layout inside the content is no more needed and the ''row'' component is deprecated.


===== Old definition =====

A ''row'' is a layout component that will lay out [[:docs:block:block|block component]] in a line.

This component is:
  * used as child component to create more sophisticated internal content layout.
  * is not responsive (the children will not wrap)
