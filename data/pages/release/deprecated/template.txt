====== Template component ======



===== About =====
The template component was a component that was turning [[:docs:templating:variable|variable]] into value.

Because combostrap supports now variable anywhere this component has been deprecated.


===== Syntax =====

The old syntax was:
<code dw>
<template>
A template with a ${variable}
</template>
