=== Put your ad on this place ? ===

An [[docs:ads:ad|ad tag]] is all what you need.

It's a syntax component that insert an ''ad'' in
your page or in a [[docs:theme:slot:slot|slot]].

This one was added in the [[:strap:sidebar|sidebar]]
of the [[docs:ads:ads|Ads]] namespace.

<btn>
[[docs:ads:ad|''Ad Tag'' all the way]]
