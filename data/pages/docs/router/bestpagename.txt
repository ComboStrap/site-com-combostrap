====== ComboStrap Routing - Best Page Name Algorithm ======


===== About =====
''Best Page Name'' is a [[action#scoring|scoring algorithm]] that is used to choose the target page to redirect to in case of [[404|missing page]].


This redirection algorithm performs always a [[docs:router:notfound|not found redirection]].

<note>
This algorithm should be in a low priority order because:
  * it does not execute any [[docs:router:permanent|permanent redirection]]
  * it performs less well than the [[docs:router:bestendpagename|best end page name]]
</note>

===== Algorithm =====

The redirection by best name page is an simple algorithm which occurs to find the best page by name.

It calculate a score for two kinds of page :

  * the [[docs:page:system:index|home pages of a namespace]]
  * the pages with the same name

===== Configuration =====

A [[#weight factor]] [[docs:app:configuration|configuration]] is applied and in this way, you can influence the redirection :

  * When a page have the same name (by default 4)
  * When a page is a start page of a namespace (by default 3)
  * When a namespace match (by default 5)

{{docs:router:best_page_name_weight_factor_conf.png|}}

===== Example =====


  * The page asked : ''namespace1:namespace2:pagename''
  * We have one page with the same name : ''namespace1:pagename''
  * We have one startpage : ''namespace1:namespace2:start''

**Score :**

  * The score for the page with the same name is : 9 = 5 (because namespace1 is present in the asked page) + 4 (because the page name match)
  * The score for the startpage is : 13 = 5 (because namespace1 is present in the asked page) + 5 (because namespace2 is present in the asked page) + 3 (because it's a start page)

In this case, the startpage is the redirect page because it have a highest score (13 against 9)
