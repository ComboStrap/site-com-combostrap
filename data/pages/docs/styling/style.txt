====== Security - Style attribute ======


===== About =====
''ComboStrap'' does not supports the style attribute for [[:security|security]] concerns.


The style attribute is deleted if found.

===== Why? =====
Via the style attribute, you can inject code. 

For instance, you can make from a link, an invisible box that takes the whole screen. If a user click on the page, it will then click on this link and be redirected. This kind of attack is known as [[kb>ClikJacking]].


===== Demo =====

Even if you try to style your component with the style attribute, they would have no effect.
<webcode name="Default">
<code dw>
<card
    style="
        color:white;
        background-color:purple;
        margin: 0 auto;
        width:50%;
        text-align: center;
        font-size:1.2rem
        "
>
A card without any style applied.
</card>
</code>
</webcode>
