====== What is a conditional value ? ======


===== About =====
A ''conditional value'' is a value that is applied only from a certain screen size (and above).


By adding the [[docs:styling:breakpoint|breakpoint name]] as a suffix, you define the minimal screen size to which the value will be applied.

===== Example =====

The below [[:docs:styling:spacing|spacing value]] is conditional and applies:
  * for small screen: a padding of 3 (ie ''p-3-xs'')
  * for medium screen ''md'' and above: a padding of 5 (ie ''p-5-md'')
<code html>
<component spacing="p-3-xs p-5-md" />
</code>

===== Syntax =====

<code html>
<component attribute="value-breakpoint" />
</code>
where:
  * ''breakpoint'' is the [[docs:styling:breakpoint|breakpoint short name]].
 
===== Default =====
  * The default breakpoint (screen size) if not specified is ''small''.
  * For the smaller breakpoints, ComboStrap applies default values that you need to overwrite.
