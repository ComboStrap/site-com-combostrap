====== What is the Public Page Cache? ======


===== About =====
For a ''anonymous'' user or a [[:docs:seo:seo|search engine]], a page may be served from the public cache:
  * [[:docs:performance:performance|speeding the rendering of the page]]
  * and therefore improving the [[:docs:seo:seo|seo performance score]]


===== How to enable? =====

The ''public cache'' is enabled when:
  * the [[:docs:theme:element:railbar|railbar]] is public private.
  * there is no message during the rendering.
