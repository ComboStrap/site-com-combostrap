====== ComboStrap - Infinite Static Cache ======


===== About =====
''infinite static cache'' is a [[cache|cache functionality]] that sends to the browser the below cache instruction:
      * cache all [[docs:content:image|images]], css, and javascript library
      * for an infinite amount of time


In reality, the files change but because the URL (ie ''https://host/my/file'') generated are unique:
  * when a file change, 
  * its URL change 
  * and the browser will ask the new file version.

===== Support =====
We support static cache on:
  * [[doku>devel:css|Dokuwiki Style Sheet]] (ie ''lib/exe/css.php'')
  * [[doku>devel:javascript|Dokuwiki Javascript]] (ie ''lib/exe/jquery.php'' and ''lib/exe/js.php'')
  * all ''public'' [[docs:content:image|images (raster, svg)]] (generated or not)
  * and all [[:credits|third libraries]]
