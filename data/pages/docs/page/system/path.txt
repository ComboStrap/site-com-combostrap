====== ComboStrap Metadata - Page Path ======



===== About =====
The ''path'' is an identifier for a page in the [[system|page system]]. 

It represents the fully qualified path in a wiki form (ie the path separator is a '':'' colon)

You can't set a path, the path is protected [[docs:metadata:metadata|page metadata]].

It can be seen in:
  * the [[docs:analytics:data|analtyics data file]].
  * the [[docs:metadata:manager|metadata manager]]

This metadata is known as [[doku>pagename]] for Dokuwiki.

===== Usage =====

==== In a page content ====

A path can be used as [[docs:templating:variable|variable]]:
  * in the page itself 
  * or in a [[:docs:templating:iterator|fragment]] 

You can create [[docs:content:link|links]] for instance:

<webcode name="Default" frameborder="0">
<code dw>
The path of this page is ''$path'' and you can use it in a link: [[$path|link to this page]]
</code>
  * Output:
</webcode>

==== In a template ====

You can also use it in a [[:docs:theme:template:template|theme template]] as variable.

<code handlebars>
{{ path }}
</code>

===== Analytics =====

By default, this is the value that is reported in a third analytics tool such as [[docs:analytics:google_analytics|Google Analytics]] but you can use the [[docs:page:canonical#google analytics|permanent canonical path]] instead.
