===== About =====
The ''namespace'' of a page is the equivalent of a directory in the [[system|page system]].


===== Example =====

  * If the [[docs:page:system:path|path]] of your page is ''group:category:page-name''
  * It's namespace is ''group:category''

<note>
  * A namespace may have a namespace. In the example above: the ''category'' namespace belongs to the namespace ''group''
  * They all materialize in a directory in a directory (ie the directory ''group'' has the child directory ''category'')
</note>


===== Usages =====

The namespace is a hierarchical data and is therefore used:
  * in the hierarchical breadcrumb
  * in the page view analytics to group views by namespace
