====== First image ======


===== About =====
The ''first image'' is an [[image|illustrative image]] that you can render with the [[:docs:content:page-image|page-image tag]].

As its name indicates, this is the first image found on your page.

You would use it generally within an [[:docs:templating:iterator|iterator]].



===== Example =====

For the purpose of the demonstration, we have included this image to act as our first image

{{:docs:content:surfer600.png?200|}}

\\

With the [[:docs:content:page-image|page image tag]], you can then show it with the following syntax

<webcode>
<code dw>
<page-image first width="400" linking="default"/>
</code>
</webcode>


===== How to see the value of the first image? =====

In the ''image'' tab of the [[:docs:metadata:manager|metadata manager]], you can also see the value of the first image.
