===== Configuration =====

If you have a high traffic, we recommend to use the [[https://sqlite.org/wal.html|write-ahead log]] to reduce blocking.
By default, Sqlite uses the old traditional journal.

Steps:

  * [[query#Go to the Sqlite Interface|Go to the sqlite interface]]
  * Check the Sqlite version (above 3.7 - 2010)

```sql
select sqlite_version();
```

  * Modify the journal to `write-ahead log` (WAL)

```sql
PRAGMA journal_mode=WAL;
```

  * Verify the new journal mode

```sql
PRAGMA journal_mode;
```
