===== About =====
''ComboStrap'' offers natively animations.

All [[docs:block:block|block component]] can be animated:
  * [[docs:animation:hover|onHover]] - when the user mouse is over a component
  * [[release:beta:onvisible|onVisible]] - when the component is visible
  * [[docs:animation:toggle|toggle]] - when the user click on a link or button

The animations are different by type of event and you need then to refer to the animation event page to have the full documentation and example.
