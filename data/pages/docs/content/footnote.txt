====== ComboStrap - Footnotes (Reference) ======




===== About =====
A ''footnote'' (([[wp>Note_(typography)]])) is a syntax component that permits to add reference that will be added at the foot of the page.

Footnotes are used most commonly to provide:
  * references (bibliographic citations) to reliable sources,
  * explanatory information or
  * source information for tables and other elements.

Without cluttering the body of the document, footnotes allow you to add:
  * notes, 
  * citations 
  * and references.

When you create a footnote, a superscript number with a link appears where you added the footnote reference. Readers can click the link to jump to the content of the footnote at the bottom of the page.



===== Syntax =====

  * A footnote (([[https://www.dokuwiki.org/wiki:syntax#footnotes|dokuwiki footnote syntax]] )) is delimited with two parenthesis.
<code dw>
(( your footnote content goes here and you can add a [[https://example.com/ref|reference link]] ))
</code>

  * You can also use [[docs:content:cite|cite]] for citation 
<code dw>
((<cite></cite>))
</code>

===== Demo =====

  * The footnote
<webcode name="Footnote" iframe frameborder=1>
<code dw>
A footnote ((A [[this>footnote|footnote]] about a footnote)) permits to add a reference in the footer of the page.

=== Reference ===

  * The result:
</webcode>

<note>
The formatting in the demo is broken because it runs in a ''iframe'' 
but it should not be in your installation. The proof is that we have added a footnote in this page and the formatting is correct.
