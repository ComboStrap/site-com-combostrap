====== ComboStrap Metadata - Organization Page ======

===== About =====
An ''organization'' page is a [[type|type of page]] that defines information about your organization.


<note>
[[docs:social:google|Google]] uses it to create the [[https://developers.google.com/search/docs/data-types/logo|knowledge panel]]
</note>
===== How to create an organization page =====
To create a page on your website that contains your organization  information such as our [[:about_us|About us]] page, you need to define the [[type|type]] to ''Organization''

Combostrap will then add the following properties:
  * ''url'': the base url
  * ''logo'': the [[docs:app:logo|logo]]
  * ''name'': the [[docs:app:name|app name]]
  * ''slogan'': the [[docs:app:tagline|slogan]]
  * the [[docs:social:twitter|twitter]] url if the handle is known
  * the [[docs:social:facebook|facebook]] url if the handle is known

===== How to add extra properties =====

You can also add extra properties such as the [[https://schema.org/Organization|organization details]] in the [[docs:social:google#json-ld|json-ld property]].


For example, in our [[:about_us|About us]] page, we have set the following properties:
<code json>
{
  "@context": "https://schema.org",
  "@type": "Organization",
  "name": "ComboStrap",
  "email": "support@combostrap.com",
  "slogan": "Growing the world GDP of publishers and creators",
  "address": {
    "@type": "PostalAddress",
    "addressLocality": "Oegstgeest, Netherlands",
    "postalCode": "2343KE"
  },
  "parentOrganization": {
    "@type": "organization",
    "name": "Bytle",
    "url": "https://bytle.net"
  }
}
</code>
