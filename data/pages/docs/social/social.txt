====== ComboStrap - Social ======

{{:docs:social:undraw_social_strategy_re_mk87.svg?0x250|}}


===== About =====
''social'' is a [[docs:seo:seo|SEO module]] that helps to improve:
  * the [[#discoverability|discoverability]]
  * the [[#card|cards]]
  * and the [[#interaction|interaction]] with your users.

===== Features =====

==== Discoverability ====

The discoverability module is based on data that are added to your page such as:
  * The type of page
  * An image
  * Your handle

The social and search engine network uses this data to:
  * style your page (ie create cards while sharing a link to your page)
  * index your pages to their search engine or in-category pages.

All social platforms should work. The below social networks have their own documentation.:
  * [[docs:social:twitter|<icon name="twitter"/> Twitter Meta]]
  * [[docs:social:facebook|<icon name="facebook"/> Facebook Meta]]
  * [[docs:social:google|<icon name="google"/> Google Meta]]
  * [[docs:social:telegram|<icon name="logos:telegram"/> Telegram]]


==== Card ====

We support all social cards.

Because social images ([[docs:social:twitter#image|twitter]], [[docs:social:google#image|google]] and [[docs:social:facebook#image|facebook]]) have all different image specifications, if the images found are not conforming (low resolution, bad type), they are not used.

<note tip>
  * As a general rule of thumb, all social images should be at least 640×320px (1280×640px for best display).
  * You could create a 40pt white margin around your image to ensure that nothing gets cropped.
</note>

==== Social Buttons ====

ComboStrap supports:
  * [[share|Share buttons]]
  * and [[follow|Follow buttons]]

==== Subscribe ====

With the [[subscribe|subscribe component]], you can let the users register to your lists.
==== Embed ====
Interaction happens through widgets embedded in your pages.

Actually, only the [[docs:social:tweet|embedded tweet]] has been implemented.
