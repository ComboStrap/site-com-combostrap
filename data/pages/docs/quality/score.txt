====== ComboStrap Quality - Score ======


===== About =====
''ComboStrap'' calculates automatically a ''quality score'' for each page.



===== Example =====

The quality score can be seen in the ''quality'' section of the [[docs:analytics:data|analytical data]].
<note info>
When the score is ''0'', it means that the [[#score|score rule]] failed.

===== Calculation =====
The principe is based on the fact that the more quality, a page has, the more points it should get. (Positive enforcement).

The calculation formula is based on:
   * the [[docs:analytics:statistics|page statistics]]
   * and the [[docs:metadata:metadata|page metadata]]

^ Score ^ Points ^ Description ^
| ''canonical_present'' | 5 | the [[docs:page:canonical|canonical]] should be present. |
| ''correct_content_length'' | 10 | When the page has a content length between a minimum and maximum of words |
| ''correct_outline'' | 3 | when the outline (headers) of the page are in correct order |
| ''correct_word_avg_by_section'' | 3 | when the average words by section is between a minimum and maximum of words |
| ''description_present'' | 8 | the [[docs:page:description|description]] is the second important metadata shown on [[docs:seo:serp|SERP pages]] |
| ''edits_count'' | 0.5 | The more edits, the more quality (points are by edits. 4 edits = 2 points) |
| ''internal_backlinks_count'' | 0.5 | The more backlinks, the better (points are by edits. 4 links = 2 points) |
| ''internal_links_count'' | 0.5 | The more internal link, the better (points are by edits. 4 links = 2 points) |
| ''no_fixme'' | 1 | point if the page does not have any ''fixme'' |
| ''no_internal_broken_links_count'' | 2 | points if the page does not have any ''broken link'' |
| ''title_present'' | 10 | the [[docs:page:title|title]] is the most important metadata shown on [[kb>SERP|SERP page]]  |



===== Own score implementation =====
<note tip>
You can also also implement your own score calculation by querying the [[docs:analytics:data|analytical data]].
