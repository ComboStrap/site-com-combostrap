====== ComboStrap Page Metadata - Locale ======

===== About =====
The ''locale'' is a [[..:metadata:metadata|page metadata]] that contains a language and a country identifier.


Example with the default value for [[..:social:facebook|facebook]] for the ''english'' language in the ''united state'' country.
<code>
en_US
</code>

It's used for localization filtering:
  * by search engine to filter the search result ([[..:social:google|Google]], ...)
  * by social engine to filter the newsfeed ([[..:social:twitter|twitter]], [[..:social:facebook|facebook]], ...).

===== Set =====

The ''locale'' can not be set directly because it's a derived value from:
  * the [[lang|language identifier]]
  * and the [[region|country identifier]]

This two values needs to be known to have a ''locale''.

===== Support =====

==== Locale does not exist ====

Php uses the locales of your operating system. If you want a certain language and a certain specific region formatting, you need to install this locale.

On Linux, you can list the installed locale with
```bash
locale -a
```
```
C
C.utf8
en_US.utf8
POSIX
```
In this case, the [[:docs:locale:region|region]] is `en` and the language `US`
